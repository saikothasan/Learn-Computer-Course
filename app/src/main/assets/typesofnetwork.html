<p>WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) helps you to link single or multiple devices using wireless communication within a limited area like home, school, or office building. It gives users an ability to move around within a local coverage area which may be connected to the network. Today most modern day's WLAN systems are based on IEEE 802.11 standards.</p>
<h3>2) Storage-Area Network (SAN)</h3>
<p>A Storage Area Network is a type of network which allows consolidated, block-level data storage. It is mainly used to make storage devices, like disk arrays, optical jukeboxes, and tape libraries.</p>
<h3>3) System-Area Network</h3>
<p>System Area Network is used for a local network. It offers high-speed connection in server-to-server and processor-to-processor applications. The computers connected on a SAN network operate as a single system at quite high speed.</p>
<h3>4) Passive Optical Local Area Network</h3>
<p>POLAN is a networking technology which helps you to integrate into structured cabling. It allows you to resolve the issues of supporting Ethernet protocols and network apps.</p>
<p>POLAN allows you to use optical splitter which helps you to separate an optical signal from a single-mode optical fiber. It converts this single signal into multiple signals.</p>
<h3>5) Home Area Network (HAN):</h3>
<p>A Home Area Network is always built using two or more interconnected computers to form a local area network (LAN) within the home. For example, in the United States, about 15 million homes have more than one computer.</p>
<p>This type of network helps computer owners to interconnect with multiple computers. This network allows sharing files, programs, printers, and other peripherals.</p>
<h3>6) Enterprise Private Network :</h3>
<p>Enterprise private network (EPN) networks are build and owned by businesses that want to securely connect numerous locations in order to share various computer resources.</p>
<h3>7) Campus Area Network (CAN):</h3>
<p>A Campus Area Network is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a specific geographical area. For example, a university campus can be linked with a variety of campus buildings to connect all the academic departments.</p>
<h3>8) Virtual Private Network:</h3>
<p>A VPN is a private network which uses a public network to connect remote sites or users together. The VPN network uses "virtual" connections routed through the internet from the enterprise's private network or a third-party VPN service to the remote site.</p>
<p>It is a free or paid service that keeps your web browsing secure and private over public WiFi hotspots.</p>
