<h1 class="entry-title">Computer Network Models</h1>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>computer network</strong>&nbsp;consists software and hardware that is used to send and receive data from one device to another. The role of hardware is to prove the physical equipment that are required in order to send and receive data while software defines the set of instructions that uses the hardware equipments for data transmission.&nbsp;<strong>A simple transmission of data consists several steps at various layers of computer network.</strong>&nbsp;In computer network models we will discuss the models in detail to&nbsp;<strong>understand how the data is actually transferred and received at a computer level</strong>.</p>
<p>Before we discuss the computer network models, lets have a discussion on the layers that a computer model consists. Lets have a basic idea of layers involved in data communication.</p>
<h2>Layers of a computer network models</h2>
<p>1. The main purpose of having several layers in a computer network model is to divide a process of sending and receiving data into small small tasks.</p>
<p>2. These layers are connected with each other, each layer provide certain data to its immediate higher and immediate lower layer and receives certain data from the same.</p>
<p>3. Dividing a model is layers makes the structure quite simple that makes it easy to identify the issue if it occurs. There are three main components of a computer network model. Sender, receiver and carrier.</p>
<p><strong>At sender Side:</strong><br /><strong>Higher layer:</strong>&nbsp;Higher layer serves the middle layer, directs the message (or data) to middle layer<br /><strong>Middle layer:</strong>&nbsp;Middle layer picks up the data from higher layer and transfer it to the lower layer<br /><strong>lower layer:</strong>&nbsp;The data is transmitted to the lower layer of the receiver side.</p>
<p><strong>At receiver Side:</strong><br /><strong>lower layer:</strong>&nbsp;Receives the data from the lower layer of sender side and transfer it to middle layer.<br /><strong>Middle layer:</strong>&nbsp;Middle layer picks up the data from lower layer and transfer to higher layer.<br /><strong>Higher layer:</strong>&nbsp;Higher layer transfers the data to the receiver.</p>
<p>4. We will discuss more than one computer models here, each model has different set and design of layers.</p>
<p>The most important computer network models are:<br />1. OSI Model<br />2. TCP/IP Model</p>
<h1>OSI Model</h1>
<p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>The OSI model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It&rsquo;s based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.</p>

<p>The lowest layer of the OSI Model is concerned with electrically or optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network from the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer of the receiving device. It can include specifications such as voltages, pin layout, cabling, and radio frequencies. At the physical layer, one might find &ldquo;physical&rdquo; resources such as network hubs, cabling, repeaters, network adapters or modems.</p>

<p>At the data link layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical layer.</p>
<p>The data link layer encompasses two sub-layers of its own. The first, media access control (MAC), provides flow control and multiplexing for device transmissions over a network. The second, the logical link control (LLC), provides flow and error control over the physical medium as well as identifies line protocols.</p>

<p>The network layer is responsible for receiving frames from the data link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among based on the addresses contained inside the frame. The network layer finds the destination by using logical addresses, such as IP (internet protocol). At this layer, routers are a crucial component used to quite literally route information where it needs to go between networks.</p>

<p>At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application. This layer sees network services provided to end-user applications such as a web browser or Office 365. The application layer identifies communication partners, resource availability, and synchronizes communication.</p>
<h1>TCP/IP Model</h1>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>OSI Model</strong>&nbsp;we just looked at is just a reference/logical model. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. But when we talk about the TCP/IP model, it was designed and developed by Department of Defense (DoD) in 1960s and is based on standard protocols. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The&nbsp;<strong>TCP/IP model</strong>&nbsp;is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model. The layers are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Process/Application Layer</li>
<li>Host-to-Host/Transport Layer</li>
<li>Internet Layer</li>
<li>Network Access/Link Layer</li>
</ol>
<p>The first layer is the Process layer on the behalf of the sender and Network Access layer on the behalf of the receiver. During this article, we will be talking on the behalf of the receiver.</p>
<h3>1. Network Access Layer &ndash;</h3>
<p>This layer corresponds to the combination of Data Link Layer and Physical Layer of the OSI model. It looks out for hardware addressing and the protocols present in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data.<br />We just talked about ARP being a protocol of Internet layer, but there is a conflict about declaring it as a protocol of Internet Layer or Network access layer. It is described as residing in layer 3, being encapsulated by layer 2 protocols.</p>
<h3>2. Internet Layer &ndash;</h3>
<p>This layer parallels the functions of OSI&rsquo;s Network layer. It defines the protocols which are responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network. The main protocols residing at this layer are :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>IP &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;stands for Internet Protocol and it is responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host by looking at the IP addresses in the packet headers. IP has 2 versions:<br />IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the one that most of the websites are using currently. But IPv6 is growing as the number of IPv4 addresses are limited in number when compared to the number of users.</li>
<li><strong>ICMP &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It is encapsulated within IP datagrams and is responsible for providing hosts with information about network problems.</li>
<li><strong>ARP &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;stands for Address Resolution Protocol. Its job is to find the hardware address of a host from a known IP address. ARP has several types: Reverse ARP, Proxy ARP, Gratuitous ARP and Inverse ARP.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Host-to-Host Layer &ndash;</h3>
<p>This layer is analogous to the transport layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data. It shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data. The two main protocols present in this layer are :</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;It is known to provide reliable and error-free communication between end systems. It performs sequencing and segmentation of data. It also has acknowledgment feature and controls the flow of the data through flow control mechanism. It is a very effective protocol but has a lot of overhead due to such features. Increased overhead leads to increased cost.</li>
<li><strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;On the other hand does not provide any such features. It is the go-to protocol if your application does not require reliable transport as it is very cost-effective. Unlike TCP, which is connection-oriented protocol, UDP is connectionless.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<h3>4. Application Layer &ndash;</h3>
<p>This layer performs the functions of top three layers of the OSI model: Application, Presentation and Session Layer. It is responsible for node-to-node communication and controls user-interface specifications. Some of the protocols present in this layer are: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, SSH, SMTP, SNMP, NTP, DNS, DHCP, NFS, X Window, LPD. Have a look at Protocols in Application Layer&nbsp;for some information about these protocols. Protocols other than those present in the linked article are :</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>HTTP and HTTPS &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;HTTP stands for Hypertext transfer protocol. It is used by the World Wide Web to manage communications between web browsers and servers. HTTPS stands for HTTP-Secure. It is a combination of HTTP with SSL(Secure Socket Layer). It is efficient in cases where the browser need to fill out forms, sign in, authenticate and carry out bank transactions.</li>
<li><strong>SSH &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;SSH stands for Secure Shell. It is a terminal emulations software similar to Telnet. The reason SSH is more preferred is because of its ability to maintain the encrypted connection. It sets up a secure session over a TCP/IP connection.</li>
<li><strong>NTP &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;NTP stands for Network Time Protocol. It is used to synchronize the clocks on our computer to one standard time source. It is very useful in situations like bank transactions. Assume the following situation without the presence of NTP. Suppose you carry out a transaction, where your computer reads the time at 2:30 PM while the server records it at 2:28 PM. The server can crash very badly if it&rsquo;s out of sync.</li>
