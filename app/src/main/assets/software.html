<h1>Computer Software</h1>
<p>Software is a collection of instructions and data that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">The two main types of software are&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="topic-paragraph">
<p>System Software</p>

<li class="topic-paragraph">
<p>Application Software</p>

<h2 class="topic-paragraph">System Software &amp; Application Software</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">System software controls a computer&rsquo;s internal functioning, chiefly through an operating system<a class="md-crosslink" href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/operating-system">,</a>&nbsp;and also controls such peripherals&nbsp;as monitors, printers, and storage devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph"><span id="ref189740"></span>Application Software, by contrast, directs the computer to execute commands given by the user and may be said to include any program that processes data for a user. Application software thus includes word processors, spreadsheets, database management, inventory and payroll programs, and many other &ldquo;applications.&rdquo; A third software category is that of&nbsp;<span id="ref189741"></span>network software, which coordinates communication between the computers linked in a network.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Software is typically stored on an external long-term memory device, such as a hard drive or magnetic diskette. When the program is in use, the computer reads it from the storage device and temporarily places the instructions in random access memory (RAM). The process of storing and then performing the instructions is called &ldquo;running,&rdquo; or &ldquo;executing,&rdquo; a program. By contrast, software programs and procedures that are permanently stored in a computer memory&nbsp;using a read-only (ROM) technology&nbsp;are called&nbsp;<span id="ref189742"></span>firmware, or &ldquo;hard software.&rdquo;</p>
