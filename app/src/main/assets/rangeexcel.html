<h1>Ranges in Excel</h1>
<p>In Microsoft Excel, a range is a collection of cells. A range can be 2 or more cells and those cells don't necessarily have to be adjacent to each other. Let's look at some examples to quickly demonstrate the different types of ranges.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
<h2>Vertical Range</h2>
<p>This vertical range is A2:A5. In this example, if you had selected the entire column A, the range would be A:A.</p>

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
<h2>Horizontal Range</h2>
<p>This horizontal range is A2:C2. In this example, if you selected the entire row 2, the range would have be 2:2.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
<h2>Mixed Range</h2>
<p>This mixed range is A2:C5. This is a collection of cells that can be from multiple rows and columns.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
<h2>Multiple Selection Range</h2>
<p>This multiple selection range is A2:A3,B4:B5. This is a collection of cells that does not have to be adjacent.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Each range has its own set of coordinates or position in the worksheet such as A2:A5, A2:C2, A2:C5, and so on.</p>
<p>There are many things that you can do with ranges in Excel such as copying, moving, formatting, and naming ranges.</p>
