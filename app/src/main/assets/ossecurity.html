<p id="31c0" class="ji jj fr jk b jl jm hn jn jo jp hr jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd di gn" data-selectable-paragraph="">Operating system security (OS security) is the process of ensuring OS integrity, confidentiality and availability.<br /><br />OS security refers to specified steps or measures used to protect the OS from threats, viruses, worms, malware or remote hacker intrusions. OS security encompasses all preventive-control techniques, which safeguard any computer assets capable of being stolen, edited or deleted if OS security is compromised.</p>
<p id="2cb7" class="ji jj fr jk b jl jm hn jn jo jp hr jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd di gn" data-selectable-paragraph="">OS security may be approached in many ways, including adherence to the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;We're going to discuss following topics in this chapter.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication refers to identifying each user of the system and associating the executing programs with those users. It is the responsibility of the Operating System to create a protection system which ensures that a user who is running a particular program is authentic. Operating Systems generally identifies/authenticates users using following three ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>Username / Password</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User need to enter a registered username and password with Operating system to login into the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User card/key</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User need to punch card in card slot, or enter key generated by key generator in option provided by operating system to login into the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User attribute - fingerprint/ eye retina pattern/ signature</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User need to pass his/her attribute via designated input device used by operating system to login into the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>One Time passwords</h2>
<p>One-time passwords provide additional security along with normal authentication. In One-Time Password system, a unique password is required every time user tries to login into the system. Once a one-time password is used, then it cannot be used again. One-time password are implemented in various ways.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>Random numbers</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Users are provided cards having numbers printed along with corresponding alphabets. System asks for numbers corresponding to few alphabets randomly chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secret key</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User are provided a hardware device which can create a secret id mapped with user id. System asks for such secret id which is to be generated every time prior to login.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network password</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Some commercial applications send one-time passwords to user on registered mobile/ email which is required to be entered prior to login.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Program Threats</h2>
<p>Operating system's processes and kernel do the designated task as instructed. If a user program made these process do malicious tasks, then it is known as&nbsp;<strong>Program Threats</strong>. One of the common example of program threat is a program installed in a computer which can store and send user credentials via network to some hacker. Following is the list of some well-known program threats.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan Horse</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Such program traps user login credentials and stores them to send to malicious user who can later on login to computer and can access system resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trap Door</strong>&nbsp;&minus; If a program which is designed to work as required, have a security hole in its code and perform illegal action without knowledge of user then it is called to have a trap door.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logic Bomb</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Logic bomb is a situation when a program misbehaves only when certain conditions met otherwise it works as a genuine program. It is harder to detect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virus</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Virus as name suggest can replicate themselves on computer system. They are highly dangerous and can modify/delete user files, crash systems. A virus is generatlly a small code embedded in a program. As user accesses the program, the virus starts getting embedded in other files/ programs and can make system unusable for user</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>System Threats</h2>
<p>System threats refers to misuse of system services and network connections to put user in trouble. System threats can be used to launch program threats on a complete network called as program attack. System threats creates such an environment that operating system resources/ user files are misused. Following is the list of some well-known system threats.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>Worm</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Worm is a process which can choked down a system performance by using system resources to extreme levels. A Worm process generates its multiple copies where each copy uses system resources, prevents all other processes to get required resources. Worms processes can even shut down an entire network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port Scanning</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Port scanning is a mechanism or means by which a hacker can detects system vulnerabilities to make an attack on the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Denial of service attacks normally prevents user to make legitimate use of the system. For example, a user may not be able to use internet if denial of service attacks browser's content settings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Computer Security Classifications</h2>
<p>As per the U.S. Department of Defense Trusted Computer System's Evaluation Criteria there are four security classifications in computer systems: A, B, C, and D. This is widely used specifications to determine and model the security of systems and of security solutions. Following is the brief description of each classification.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>S.N.</th>
<th>Classification Type &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Type A</strong></p>
<p>Highest Level. Uses formal design specifications and verification techniques. Grants a high degree of assurance of process security.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Type B</strong></p>
<p>Provides mandatory protection system. Have all the properties of a class C2 system. Attaches a sensitivity label to each object. It is of three types.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>B1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Maintains the security label of each object in the system. Label is used for making decisions to access control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Extends the sensitivity labels to each system resource, such as storage objects, supports covert channels and auditing of events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Allows creating lists or user groups for access-control to grant access or revoke access to a given named object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Type C</strong></p>
<p>Provides protection and user accountability using audit capabilities. It is of two types.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>C1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Incorporates controls so that users can protect their private information and keep other users from accidentally reading / deleting their data. UNIX versions are mostly Cl class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Adds an individual-level access control to the capabilities of a Cl level system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Type D</strong></p>
<p>Lowest level. Minimum protection. MS-DOS, Window 3.1 fall in this category.</p>
</td>
</tr>
