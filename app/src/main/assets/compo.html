<h1>Components of a Computer System</h1>
<p>Every computer system has the following three basic components:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Input unit</li>
<li>Central processing unit</li>
<li>Output unit</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Input Unit</strong></h2>
<p>These components help users enter data and commands into a&nbsp;computer&nbsp;system. Data can be in the form of numbers, words, actions, commands, etc.&nbsp;The main function of input devices&nbsp;is to direct commands and data into computers. Computers then use their CPU to process this data and produce output.</p>
<p>Another example of input devices is&nbsp;touch-screens. Users can simply touch these screens without using any other device to enter commands. From smartphones to ATM&nbsp;machines, these input devices are becoming very popular these days.</p>
<h2>Central Processing Unit</h2>
<p>After receiving data and commands from users, a computer system now has to process it according to the instructions provided. Here, it has to rely on a component called the central processing unit.&nbsp;The CPU further uses these three elements:</p>
<h3><strong>Memory Unit</strong></h3>
<p>Once a user enters data using input devices, the computer system stores this data in its memory unit. This data will now remain here until other components of CPU process it. The memory&nbsp;unit uses a set&nbsp;of pre-programmed instructions to further transmit this data to other parts of the CPU.</p>
<h3><strong>Arithmetic and Logic Unit</strong></h3>
<p>This part of the CPU performs arithmetic operations. It does basic&nbsp;mathematical calculations&nbsp;like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, etc. Further, it can even perform logical&nbsp;functions like the comparison of data.</p>
<h3>Control Unit</h3>
<p>This unit is the backbone of computers. It is responsible for coordinating tasks between all components of a computer system. The control unit collects data from input units and sends it to processing units depending on its nature.&nbsp;Finally, it also further transmits processed data to output units for users.</p>
<h2><strong>Output Unit</strong></h2>
<p>The third and final component of a computer system is the output unit. After processing of data, it is converted into a format which humans can understand. After conversion, the output units displays this data to users. Examples of output devices include monitors, screens, printers and speakers. Thus, output units basically reproduce the data formatted by the computer for users&rsquo; benefit.</p>
