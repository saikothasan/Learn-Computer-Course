<h1 class="definition-title">Disaster recovery plan (DRP)</h1>
<p>A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a documented, structured approach that describes how an organization can quickly resume work after an unplanned incident. A DRP is an essential part of a business continuity plan (BCP). It is applied to the aspects of an organization that depend on a functioning IT infrastructure. A DRP aims to help an organization resolve data loss and recover system functionality so that it can perform in the aftermath of an incident, even if it operates at a minimal level.</p>
<p>The step-by-step plan consists of the precautions to minimize the effects of a disaster so the organization can continue to operate or quickly resume mission-critical functions. Typically, disaster recovery planning involves an analysis of business processes and continuity needs. Before generating a detailed plan, an organization often performs a business impact analysis&nbsp;(BIA) and risk analysis&nbsp;(RA), and it establishes recovery objectives.</p>
<p>As cybercrime and security breaches become more sophisticated, it is important for an organization to define its data recovery and protection strategies. The ability to quickly handle incidents can reduce downtime and minimize both financial and reputational damages. Furthermore, DRPs allow organizations to ensure they meet all compliance requirements, while also providing a clear roadmap to recovery.</p>
<p>Some types of disasters that organizations can plan for include:</p>
<ul class="default-list">
<li>Application failure</li>
<li>Communication failure</li>
<li>Data center disaster</li>
<li>Building disaster</li>
<li>Campus disaster</li>
<li>Citywide disaster</li>
<li>Regional disaster</li>
<li>National disaster</li>
<li>Multinational disaster</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title">Recovery plan considerations</h3>
<p>A disaster recovery strategy should start at the business level and determine which applications are most important to running the organization. The recovery time objective&nbsp;(RTO) describes the target amount of time a business application can be down, typically measured in hours, minutes or seconds. The recovery point objective&nbsp;(RPO) describes the age of files that must be recovered from&nbsp;backup storage&nbsp;for normal operations to resume.</p>
<p>Recovery strategies define an organization's plans for responding to an incident, while disaster recovery plans describe how the organization should respond. Recovery plans are derived from recovery strategies.</p>
<p>In determining a recovery strategy, organizations should consider such issues as:</p>
<ul class="default-list">
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Insurance coverage</li>
<li>Resources -- people and physical facilities</li>
<li>Management's position on risks</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Suppliers</li>
<li>Compliance requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Management approval of recovery strategies is important. All strategies should align with the organization's goals. Once disaster recovery strategies have been developed and approved, they can be translated into disaster recovery plans.</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Types of disaster recovery plans</h3>
<p>DRPs can be specifically tailored for a given environment. Some environment-specific plans include:</p>
<ul class="default-list">
<li><strong>Virtualized disaster recovery plan -</strong>&nbsp;Virtualization provides opportunities to implement disaster recovery in a more efficient and simpler way. A virtualized environment can spin up new virtual machine (VM) instances within minutes and provide application recovery through high Availability. Testing can also be easier to achieve, but the plan must include the ability to validate that applications can be run in disaster recovery mode and returned to normal operations within the RPO and RTO.</li>
<li><strong>Network disaster recovery plan -</strong>&nbsp;Developing a plan for recovering a network gets more complicated as the complexity of the network increases. It is important to detail the step-by-step recovery procedure, test it properly and keep it updated. Data in this plan will be specific to the network, such as in its performance and networking staff.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud disaster recovery plan -</strong>&nbsp;Cloud disaster recovery&nbsp;(cloud DR) can range from a file backup in the cloud to a complete replication. Cloud DR can be space, time and cost-efficient, but maintaining the disaster recovery plan requires proper management. The manager must know the location of physical and virtual servers. The plan must address security, which is a common issue in the cloud that can be alleviated through testing.</li>
<li><strong>Data center disaster recovery plan -</strong>&nbsp;This type of plan focuses exclusively on the data center facility and infrastructure. An operational risk assessment is a key element in data center DRPs. It analyzes key components such as building location, power systems and protection, security, and office space. The plan must address a broad range of possible scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<section class="section main-article-chapter" data-menu-title="Scope and objectives of DR planning">
<h3 class="section-title">Scope and objectives of DR planning</h3>
<p>A disaster recovery plan can range in scope from basic to comprehensive. Some DRPs can be upward of 100 pages long.</p>
<p>Disaster recovery budgets can vary greatly and fluctuate over time. Organizations can take advantage of free resources, such as online DRP templates. Several organizations, such as the Busineess Continuity Institute&nbsp;and Disaster Recovery Institute International, also provide free information and online how-to articles.</p>
<p>A disaster recovery plan checklist includes identifying critical IT systems and networks, prioritizing the RTO, and outlining the steps needed to restart, reconfigure and recover systems and networks. The plan should at least minimize any negative effect on business operations. Employees should know basic emergency steps in the event of an unforeseen incident.</p>
<p>Distance is an important, but often overlooked, element of the DRP process. A disaster recovery site that is close to the primary data center may seem ideal -- in terms of cost, convenience, bandwidth&nbsp;and testing -- but outages differ greatly in scope. A severe regional event can destroy the primary data center and its disaster recovery site if the two are located too close together.</p>

<h3 class="section-title">How to build a disaster recovery plan</h3>
<p>The disaster recovery plan process involves more than simply writing the document. Before writing the DRP, risk analysis and business impact analysis can help determine where to focus resources in the disaster recovery planning process. The BIA identifies the impacts of disruptive events and is the starting point for identifying risk within the context of disaster recovery. It also generates the RTO and RPO. The RA identifies threats and vulnerabilities that could disrupt the operation of systems and processes highlighted in the BIA. The RA assesses the likelihood of a disruptive event and outlines its potential severity.</p>
<p>A DRP checklist should include the following steps:</p>
<ul class="default-list">
<li>establishing the range or extent of necessary treatment and activity -- the scope of recovery;</li>
<li>gathering relevant network infrastructure documents;</li>
<li>identifying the most serious threats and vulnerabilities, and the most critical assets;</li>
<li>reviewing the history of unplanned incidents and outages, and how they were handled;</li>
<li>identifying the current disaster recovery strategies;</li>
<li>identifying the incident response team;</li>
<li>having management review and approve the DRP;</li>
<li>testing the plan;</li>
<li>updating the plan; and</li>
<li>implementing a DRP audit.</li>
</ul>
