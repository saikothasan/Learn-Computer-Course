<h1>Computer hardware</h1>
<p>Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit, monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard. By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware.</p>
<h2><strong>Different Types Of Computer Hardware</strong></h2>

<h2>Relationship between Hardware and Software</h2>
<ul class="list" style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p>Hardware and software are mutually dependent on each other. Both of them must work together to make a computer produce a useful output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software cannot be utilized without supporting hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware without a set of programs to operate upon cannot be utilized and is useless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To get a particular job done on the computer, relevant software should be loaded into the hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware is a one-time expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software development is very expensive and is a continuing expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different software applications can be loaded on a hardware to run different jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A software acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the hardware is the 'heart' of a computer system, then the software is its 'soul'. Both are complementary to each other.</p>
