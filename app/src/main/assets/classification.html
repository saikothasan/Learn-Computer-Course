<h1>Classification of Computers</h1>
<p>The computer systems can be classified on the following basis:</p>
<p>1. On the basis of size.<br />2. On the basis of functionality.<br />3. On the basis of data handling.</p>
<p>According to purpose, computers are either general purpose or specific purpose.&nbsp;<strong>General purpose computers</strong>&nbsp;are designed to perform a range of tasks.&nbsp;They have the ability to store numerous programs, but lack in speed and efficiency. Specific purpose computers are designed to handle a specific problem or to perform a specific task. A set of instructions is built into the machine.</p>
<h2><strong>Type of computers</strong>&nbsp;on the basis of Functionality &amp; Data Handling:</h2>
<h2>Analog Computer&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;An analog computer&nbsp;(spelt analogue in British English) is a form of computer&nbsp;that uses&nbsp;<em>continuous&nbsp;</em>physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model the problem being solved.</p>
<h2><span id="Digital_Computer" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Digital Computer</h2>
<p>&nbsp;A computer&nbsp;that performs calculations and logical operations with quantities represented as digits, usually in the binary number system.</p>
<h2>Hybrid computer</h2>
<p><strong>Hybrid computers</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>computers</strong>&nbsp;that exhibit features of analog&nbsp;<strong>computers</strong>&nbsp;and digital&nbsp;<strong>computers</strong>. The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical and numerical operations, while the analog component often serves as a solver of differential equations and other mathematically complex equations.</p>
<h2><strong>Type of computers</strong>&nbsp;on the basis of Size:</h2>
<h2>Super Computer&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong></h2>
<p>The fastest and most powerful type of computer Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for specialized applications that require immense amounts of mathematical calculations. For example, weather forecasting requires a supercomputer. Other uses of supercomputers include animated graphics, fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, and petroleum exploration.</p>
<p>The chief difference between a supercomputer&nbsp;and a mainframe&nbsp;is that a supercomputer channels all its power into executing a few programs as fast as possible, whereas a mainframe&nbsp;uses its power to execute many programs concurrently.</p>
<h2><span id="Mainframe_Computer" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Mainframe Computer</h2>
<p>A very large and expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds, or even thousands, of users simultaneously. In the hierarchy that starts with a simple microprocessor&nbsp;(in watches, for example) at the bottom and moves to supercomputers at the top, mainframes are just below supercomputers. In some ways, mainframes are more powerful than supercomputers because they support more simultaneous programs. But supercomputers can execute a single program faster than a mainframe.</p>
<h2><span id="Mini_Computer" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Mini Computer&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A mid sized computer. In size and power, minicomputers lie between&nbsp;<em>workstations&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>mainframes</em>. In the past decade, the distinction between large minicomputers and small mainframes has blurred, however, as has the distinction between small minicomputers and workstations. But in general, a minicomputer&nbsp;is a multiprocessing system capable of supporting from 4 to about 200 users simultaneously.</p>
<h2><span id="Micro_Computer_or_Personal_Computer" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Micro Computer or Personal Computer</h2>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Desktop Computer</strong>: a personal or micro-mini computer sufficient to fit on a desk.</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Laptop&nbsp;Computer</strong>: a portable computer complete with an integrated screen and keyboard. It is generally smaller in size than a desktop computer and larger than a notebook computer.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Palmtop Computer/Digital Diary /Notebook /PDAs</strong>: a hand-sized computer. Palmtops have no keyboard but the screen serves both as an input and output devices.</p>
<h2><span id="Workstations" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Workstations</h2>
<p>A terminal or desktop computer in a network. In this context, workstation is just a generic term for a user&rsquo;s machine (client machine) in contrast to a &ldquo;server&rdquo; or &ldquo;mainframe.&rdquo;</p>
