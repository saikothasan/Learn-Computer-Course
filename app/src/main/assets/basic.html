<h1>Basics of computer</h1>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>computer</strong>&nbsp;is a machine&nbsp;that can be instructed to carry out sequences&nbsp;of arithmetic&nbsp;or logical&nbsp;operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs<em>.</em>&nbsp;These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system&nbsp;(main software), and peripheral&nbsp;equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>computer system</strong>. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network&nbsp;or computer cluster.</p>
<p>Computers are used as control system&nbsp;for a wide variety of industrial&nbsp;and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave oven&nbsp;and remote contols, factory devices such as industrial robots&nbsp;and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like persnol computer&nbsp;and mobile devices&nbsp;such as smartphones. The Internet&nbsp;is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of Computer</h2>
<p class="Default"><strong>1. Speed: &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>As you know computer&nbsp;can work very fast. It takes only few seconds for calculations that we take hours to complete. You will be surprised to know that computer&nbsp;can perform millions (1,000,000) of instructions and even more per second.<span id="more-25"></span></p>
<p class="Default">Therefore, we determine the speed of computer in terms of microsecond (10-6 part of a second) or nanosecond (10 to the power -9 part of a second). From this you can imagine how fast your computer performs work.</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>2. Accuracy: &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>The degree of accuracy of computer is very high and every calculation is performed with the same accuracy. The accuracy level is&nbsp;<strong>7.</strong></p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="Default">determined on the basis of design of computer. The errors in computer are due to human and inaccurate data.</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>3. Diligence: &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>A computer is free from tiredness, lack of concentration, fatigue, etc. It can work for hours without creating any error. If millions of calculations are to be performed, a computer will perform every calculation with the same accuracy. Due to this capability it overpowers human being in routine type of work.</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>4. Versatility: &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>It means the capacity to perform completely different type of work. You may use your computer to prepare payroll slips. Next moment you may use it for inventory management or to prepare electric bills.</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>5. Power of Remembering: &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Computer has the power of storing any amount of information&nbsp;or data. Any information&nbsp;can be stored and recalled as long as you require it, for any numbers of years. It depends entirely upon you how much data you want to store in a computer and when to lose or retrieve these data.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="Default"><strong>6. No IQ: &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Computer is a dumb machine&nbsp;and it cannot do any work without instruction from the user. It performs the instructions at tremendous speed and with accuracy. It is you to decide what you want to do and in what sequence. So a computer cannot take its own decision as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>7. No Feeling: &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>It does not have feelings or emotion, taste, knowledge and experience. Thus it does not get tired even after long hours of work. It does not distinguish between users.</p>
<p><strong>8. Storage: &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>The Computer has an in-built memory where it can store a large amount of data. You can also store data in secondary storage devices&nbsp;such as floppies, which can be kept outside your computer and can be carried to other computers.</p>
<h2>Basic Parts of Computer</h2>
<h3 class="clearfl">Computer case</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>computer case</strong>&nbsp;is the metal and plastic box that&nbsp;<strong>contains the main components</strong>&nbsp;of the computer, including the motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), and power supply. The front of the case usually has an&nbsp;<strong>On/Off button</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>one or more&nbsp;<strong>optical drives</strong>.</p>
<p>Computer cases come in different shapes and sizes. A&nbsp;<strong>desktop case</strong>&nbsp;lies flat on a desk, and the monitor usually sits on top of it. A&nbsp;<strong>tower case</strong>&nbsp;is tall and sits next to the monitor or on the floor.&nbsp;<strong>All-in-one</strong>&nbsp;computers come with the internal components built into the monitor, which eliminates the need for a separate case.</p>
<h3>Monitor</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>monitor</strong>&nbsp;works with a&nbsp;<strong>video card</strong>, located inside the computer case, to display images and text on the screen. Most monitors have&nbsp;<strong>control buttons</strong>&nbsp;that allow you to change your monitor's display settings, and some monitors also have built-in speakers.</p>
<p>Newer monitors usually have&nbsp;<strong>LCD</strong>&nbsp;(liquid crystal display) or&nbsp;<strong>LED</strong>&nbsp;(light-emitting diode) displays. These can be made very thin, and they are often called&nbsp;<strong>flat-panel displays</strong>. Older monitors use&nbsp;<strong>CRT</strong>&nbsp;(cathode ray tube) displays. CRT monitors are much larger and heavier, and they take up more desk space.</p>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>keyboard</strong>&nbsp;is one of the main ways to communicate with a computer. There are many different types of keyboards, but most are&nbsp;<strong>very similar</strong>&nbsp;and allow you to accomplish the same basic tasks.</p>
<h3>Mouse</h3>
<div>The&nbsp;<strong>mouse</strong>&nbsp;is another important tool for communicating with computers. Commonly known as a&nbsp;<strong>pointing device</strong>, it lets you&nbsp;<strong>point</strong>&nbsp;to objects on the screen,&nbsp;<strong>click</strong>&nbsp;on them, and&nbsp;<strong>move</strong>&nbsp;them.</div>
<p>There are two main mouse types: optical and mechanical. The&nbsp;<strong>optical</strong>&nbsp;mouse uses an electronic eye to detect movement and is easier to clean. The&nbsp;<strong>mechanical mouse</strong>&nbsp;uses a rolling ball to detect movement and requires regular cleaning to work properly.</p>
<h3>Mouse alternatives</h3>
<p>There are other devices that can do the same thing as a mouse. Many people find them easier to use, and they also require less desk space than a traditional mouse. The most common mouse alternatives are below.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Trackball</strong>: A trackball has a ball that can rotate freely. Instead of moving the device like a mouse, you can roll the ball with your thumb to move the pointer.</li>
<li><strong>Touchpad</strong>: A touchpad&mdash;also called a&nbsp;<strong>trackpad</strong>&mdash;is a touch-sensitive pad that lets you control the pointer by making a drawing motion with your finger. Touchpads are common on laptop computers.</li>
</ul>
