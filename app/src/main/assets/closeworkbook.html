<h1 class="">Close workbooks or workbook windows</h1>
<p class="">When your computer is running a single instance of Excel, all workbooks that you open are opened in a workbook window inside the Excel window. You can also create new workbook windows for any worksheet in a workbook by using the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">New Window</strong>&nbsp;command (<strong class="ocpUI">View</strong>&nbsp;tab,&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Window</strong>&nbsp;group).</p>
<p>You can close each of these workbook windows one at a time, or you can close the entire workbook (including all of its workbook windows). To close all workbooks that are open, you can close the Excel window or exit Excel.</p>
