<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the digital data. To increase the storage capacity in terms of number of bits, you can use a group of flip-flops. Such a group of flip-flops is known as a Register. The n-bit register will consist of n number of flip-flop(s) and it is capable of storing an n-bit word.</p>
<p>The binary-data, in a register, can be transfered within itself from one flip-flop to another. A shift register is a type of register that allows such data transfers. Shift register has 4 modes of operations.</p>
<h2>Shift Registers</h2>
<p>A shift register is a piece of circuit that you will find inside a microprocessor. It is used to store and modify data. Now this is one of the simplest explanation I can give for a 2nd grade student.</p>
<p>But if you are some one who is studying about computers, this is just not sufficient. So I will have to explain it in a bit more detail. Alright? I will be getting a bit technical here. But it is how you will get a solid understanding of shift register. So you will have to bare it. Okay?</p>
<h2 id="sub-modules">Sub-modules</h2>
<p>The sub-modules of digital registers are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serial-in Serial-out</li>
<li>Serial-in Parallel-out</li>
<li>Parallel-in Serial-out</li>
<li>Parallel-in Parallel-out</li>
</ol>
<h2>Types Of Shift Registers</h2>
<p>Based on the way the data is shifted, we have 5 different types of shift registers. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left Shift Registers</li>
<li>Right Shift Registers</li>
<li>Bidirectional Shift Registers</li>
<li>Circular Shift Registers &amp;</li>
<li>Linear Feedback Shift Registers</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let explain what each of these registers work like:</p>
<h3><span id="Left_Shift_Registers" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Left Shift Registers</h3>
<p>We have already talked about the left shift register. So I think you are familiar with it by now. If not, let me re-iterate. So in the case of a left shift register, the data is shifted to the left on each clock cycle.</p>
<h3><span id="Right_Shift_Registers" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Right Shift Registers</h3>
<p>This is just like the left shift register. But here it is shifting the data to the right on each clock cycle.</p>
<h3><span id="Bidirectional_Shift_Registers" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Bidirectional Shift Registers</h3>
<p>In the case of a bidirectional shift register, we can shift the data in both the directions. So you can shift the data either to it&rsquo;s left or right!</p>
<h3><span id="Circular_Shift_Registers" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Circular Shift Registers</h3>
<p>In the case of a circular shift register, the last output is connected back as input. So your data will not be thrown out. Instead, will be shifted either left or right in a circular fashion!</p>
<h3><span id="Linear_Feedback_Shift_Registers" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Linear Feedback Shift Registers</h3>
<p>In this type of shift register, the input of one flip flop will be linear output value of the previous flip flop.</p>
<h2><span id="Advantages_Disadvantages_Of_A_Shift_Register" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages Of A Shift Register</h2>
<p>It is now time to talk about the advantages &amp; disadvantages of using a shift register. So what are they?</p>
<h3><span id="Advantages_Of_A_Shift_Register" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Advantages Of A Shift Register</h3>
<ul>
<li>They are very fast to use.</li>
<li>Very quick when you want to convert data from serial to parallel or vice versa. They are faster than normal serial to parallel converter circuits.</li>
<li>They are very simple in design. So you can easily rig up a circuit to create a shift register.</li>
<li>We can use them to encrypt or decrypt the data.</li>
<li>We can use them to a delay signal.</li>
<li>It is used in CDMA to generate Pseudo Noise Sequence Number.</li>
<li>We can use them to track our data!</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Disadvantages_Of_A_Shift_Register" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Disadvantages Of A Shift Register</h3>
<p>While we could see that it has major advantages, shift register has one major disadvantage. That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The strength of the output current coming from a shift register is not so strong.</li>
</ul>
