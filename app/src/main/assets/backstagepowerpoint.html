<p>The Backstage view in Powerpoint Online provides access to the File menu and some other options. However, don&rsquo;t expect the Backstage view within PowerPoint Online to be as full featured, compared to the Backstage view in PowerPoint&rsquo;s desktop versions&mdash;in fact, there&rsquo;s almost no feature to control interface elements. The options here mainly accomplish basic tasks such as sharing, saving, downloading, etc.</p>
<p>You access&nbsp;<strong>Backstage</strong>&nbsp;view from the&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;tab, as shown in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 1</strong>, below. The&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;tab, highlighted in&nbsp;<span class="izblue">blue</span>&nbsp;is placed towards the extreme-left of the Ribbon.</p>

<p>Although it looks like a tab, the&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;tab brings up a menu on the left side of the&nbsp;<strong>Backstage</strong>&nbsp;view that it spawns, as shown in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2</strong>. Notice that there are no other menus &nbsp;Within Powerpoint Interface&nbsp;<strong>Backstage</strong>&nbsp;view, you'll find features for managing your PowerPoint presentation files, creating and saving files, printing slides, downloading and sharing.</p>

<p>When Backstage view is open, you can find several options on the left side. These options, when selected open individual Panes. Here is a a brief introduction to these options:</p>
<h2>Info</h2>

If you want to open a presentation that is not listed here, click the&nbsp;<strong>More on OneDrive</strong>&nbsp;link (highlighted in&nbsp;<span class="izred">red</span>&nbsp;within&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2</strong>), navigate to the OneDrive folder where you have saved it, and open it.</p>

<h2>Save a Copy</h2>
<p>There is no Save option in PowerPoint Online since PowerPoint saves after every change you make automatically. If you want to go back to a previous stage in your presentation, you can use PowerPoint Online&rsquo;s versioning feature that&rsquo;s accessed from the Info option in backstage view. Also, you can save the open presentation as a new presentation (a copy) using the&nbsp;<strong>Save a Copy</strong>&nbsp;option, shown in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 3</strong>, below.</p>
