<p>The option of giving you the possibility to protect your document from editing is found here as well as the list of the document&rsquo;s properties below the&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;button. If you need to know the document&rsquo;s size, quantity of words, date of last modification, or author&rsquo;s name, you can find them in this list. To get more information, such as the company name or document&rsquo;s status, click&nbsp;<strong>Show All Properties</strong>&nbsp;in the drop-down.</p>
<p>After clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;button, you&rsquo;ll get access to&nbsp;<strong>Advanced properties</strong>. Hit that to get a pop-up window with tab marks.
