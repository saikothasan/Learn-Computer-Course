<h1>Evolution of Microprocessors</h1>
<p>Transistor was invented in 1948 (23 December 1947 in Bell lab). IC was invented in 1958 (Fair Child Semiconductors) By Texas Instruments J kilby. First microprocessor was invented by INTEL(INTegrated ELectronics).</p>
<h2><strong>Types of microprocessors:</strong></h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Complex instruction set microprocessor &ndash;</strong><br />The processors are designed to minimise the number of instructions per program and ignore the number of cycles per instructions. The compiler is used to translate a high level language to assembly level language because the length of code is relatively short and an extra RAM is used to store the instructions. These processors can do tasks like downloading, uploading and recalling data from memory. Apart from these tasks these microprocessor can perform complex mathematical calculation in a single command.<br />Example: IBM 370/168, VAX 11/780</li>
<li><strong>Reduced instruction set microprocessor &ndash;</strong><br />These processor are made according to function. They are designed to reduce the execution time by using the simplified instruction set. They can carry out small things in specific commands. These processors complete commands at faster rate. They require only one clock cycle to implement a result at uniform execution time. There are number of registers and less number of transistors. To access the memory location LOAD and STORE instructions are used.<br />Example: Power PC 601, 604, 615, 620</li>
<li><strong>Super scalar microprocessor &ndash;</strong><br />These processors can perform many tasks at a time. They can be used for ALUs and multiplier like array. They have multiple operation unit and perform tasts my executing multiple commands.</li>
<li><strong>Application specific integrated circuit &ndash;</strong><br />These processors are application specific like for personal digital assistant computers. They are designed according to proper specification.</li>
<li><strong>Digital signal multiprocessor &ndash;</strong><br />These processors are used to convert signals like analog to digital or digital to analog. The chips of these processors are used in many devices such as RADAR SONAR home theatres etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Advantages of microprocessor&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>High processing speed</li>
<li>Compact size</li>
<li>Easy maintenance</li>
<li>Can perform complex mathematics</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Can be improved according to requirement</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Disadvantages of microprocessors&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Overheating occurs due to overuse</li>
<li>Performance depends on size of data</li>
<li>Large board size than microcontrollers</li>
<li>Most microprocessors do not support floating point operations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development Explosion: The 1970s</h3>
<p>The idea of the computer on single chip described in the literature earlier. Finally process had caught up to thinking &amp; the computer on the chip was made it possible. The air was an electric with the possibility .</p>
<p>Once feat establish rest of the decade saw the prolife of the companies old &amp; new getting into semiconductor business as first pc, first arcade games &amp; even the first home video game sys are also spreading consumers contacts with the electronics &amp; paving way for continued rapid growth in b/w 80s.</p>
<p>At beginning of the 70s microprocessors yet not introduced. By end of the decade saturated market led to price wars &amp; processors were already introduced16-bit.</p>
<p>Three groups claim for the first to put the computer on a chip. The Central Air Data Computer &amp; the Intel &amp; the Texas Instruments TMS 1000.</p>
<h3>Early Intel- 4004&amp; 8008 &amp; 8080</h3>
<p>Intel released their 1st single 4-bit all purpose chip the Intel 4004 in Nov 1971. Its clock speed of 108KHz &amp; 2,300 transistors with ports for ROM &amp; RAM &amp; I/O. Originally it was designed for use in the calculator Intel had to negotiate its contract to become able to market its product &amp; stand alone processor.</p>
<p>Intel 8008 was introduced in the month of April 1972 &amp; didn&rsquo;t make much splash being more or less 8-bit 4004. Its primary claim was form the basis for 8080 later 8086 architecture.</p>
<p>Intel put back with the 8080 which was used the same instruction set earlier by the 8008 and is generally considered to be first usable microprocessor.</p>
<p>Where is Intel stand now?<br />Last time when we checked Intel was on the still &ndash; around.</p>
<h3>RCA- 1802</h3>
<p>In 1974 RCA released the 1802 of the 8-bit processor with an different architecture than the other 8-bit processors. It consist of a register file of 16 registers that is of 16 bits each &amp; using the SEP instruction you can select any of the registers be the program counter.</p>
<p>Interesting variation was the two or more than two subroutines a ring so that they were to the be called as the roundrobin order. The RCA 1802 was considered one of the first risc chips.</p>
<h3>IBM 801</h3>
<p>In 1975 IBM produced some earliest efforts to build microprocessor based on RISC design. IBM 801 was named after address of where the chip designed but suspect that IBM systems already numbered 601 &amp; 701.</p>
<h3>The Evolution Of RISC</h3>
<p>RISC Relegate the Important Stuff to the Compiler &amp; known as load store architectures.</p>
<p>In the 1970 research at IBM produced result that the some of the operations are actually slower than the number of smaller operations doing same thing. A famous eg. was the VAX&rsquo;sINDEX instruction which ran slower than loop implementing same code.</p>
<h3>Moto 6800</h3>
<p>Motorola introduced 6800 chip in the 1978 with the 78 instructions &amp; probably the first microprocessor with index register.</p>
<p>When comes to program flexibility &amp; maintenance they are the wasteful when it was comes using scarce computer memory.</p>
<p>Motorola is the only stand alone processors &amp; microcontrollers trace their lineage to mbdew 6800 including popular &amp; powerful 6809 of 1979.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The microprocessor are their around for more than 20 years already. It is now comes in many forms sizes &amp; levels of sophistication powering all the kinds of applications that they rely on control of computer.althouh the cpu of computer system it needs to interact with some other semiconductor device in order to perform functions. And devices include memory &amp; input/output devices constitute rest of the computer system.Thus we know from where microprocessor evolutes &amp; till where goes.</p>
