<h1>SmartArt</h1>
<p>PowerPoint offers a unique feature called SmartArt which allows users to add text to predefined art designs. The advantage with SmartArt is that although each component of the SmartArt can be edited individually, you can also modify the SmartArt as a whole while retaining the settings on each individual component.</p>
<p>The following steps will help you add a SmartArt to PowerPoint.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Go to the&nbsp;<strong>Illustrations</strong>&nbsp;group under the&nbsp;<strong>Insert</strong>&nbsp;ribbon.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Click on the&nbsp;<strong>SmartArt</strong>&nbsp;command to open the&nbsp;<strong>Choose a SmartArt Graphic</strong>&nbsp;dialog. You can choose the SmartArt category and pick individual SmartArt types from the list. You also get a preview and a short description of the graphic in the preview section.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Select the SmartArt type and click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;or double-click on the SmartArt type to insert the graphic in the slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The graphic is inserted in the slide along with a text pane where you can enter/ modify the SmartArt text.</p>
