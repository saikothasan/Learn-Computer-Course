<h1 class="">Insert a screenshot&nbsp;</h1>
<p class="">You can quickly and easily add a screenshot to your Office file to enhance readability or capture information without leaving the program that you are working in. This feature is available in Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word.</p>
<p>Screenshots are useful for capturing snapshots of programs or windows that you have open on your computer. When you click the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Screenshot</strong>&nbsp;button, open program windows are displayed as thumbnails in the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Available Windows</strong>&nbsp;gallery. You can insert the whole program window, or use the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Screen Clipping</strong>&nbsp;tool to select part of a window. Only windows that have not been minimized to the taskbar can be captured.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Available Windows</strong>&nbsp;gallery appears, showing you all the windows that you currently have open. Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To insert a screenshot of an entire window into your document, click the thumbnail image of that window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add a selected portion of the first window shown in the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Available Windows</strong>&nbsp;gallery, click&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Screen Clipping</strong>; when the screen turns white and the pointer becomes a cross, press and hold the left mouse button and drag to select the part of the screen that you want to capture.</p>

<div class="ocpAlert">
<p class="ocpAlertSection"><strong class="ocpNote">Tip:</strong>&nbsp;If you have multiple windows open, you'll first need to click the window you want to capture before starting the screenshot process. This will move that window to the first position in the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Available Windows</strong>&nbsp;gallery. For example, if you want to take a screen clipping from a web page and insert it into a Word document, first click the screen with the website, and then go directly to your Word document and click&nbsp;<strong class="ocpLegacyBold">Screenshot</strong>. The screen with the web page will be in the first position in the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Available Windows</strong>&nbsp;gallery, and you can click&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Screen Clipping</strong>&nbsp;to select a portion of that screen.</p>

</ul>

<p>The window or portion of the screen you selected is automatically added to your document. You can use the tools on the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Picture Tools</strong>&nbsp;tab to edit and enhance the screenshot.</p>
