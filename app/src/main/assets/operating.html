<h1>Operating System</h1>
<p>An operating system is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.</p>
<h3>Examples of Operating System</h3>
<p>Some examples include versions of Microsoft Windows (like Windows 10,&nbsp;<strong>Windows 8</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Windows 7</strong>, Windows Vista, and Windows XP), Apple's macOS (formerly OS X), Chrome OS, BlackBerry Tablet OS, and flavors of Linux, an open-source operating system.</p>
<h2 data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Objectives of Operating System</strong></h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Making a computer system convenient to use in an efficient manner</li>
<li>To hide the details of the hardware resources from the users</li>
<li>To provide users a convenient interface to use the computer system.</li>
<li>To act as an intermediary between the hardware and its users and making it easier for the users to access and use other resources.</li>
<li>Manage the resources of a computer system.</li>
<li>keep track of who is using which resource, granting resource requests, according for resource using and mediating conflicting requests from different programs and users.</li>
<li>The efficient and fair sharing of resources among users and programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Characteristics of Operating System</strong></h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Memory Management</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; It keeps tracks of primary memory i.e what part of it are in use by whom, what part are not in use etc. Allocates the memory when the process or program request it.</li>
<li><strong>Processor Management</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Allocate the processor(CPU) to a process. Deallocate processor when processor is no longer required.</li>
<li><strong>Device Management</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Keep tracks of all devices. This is also called I/O controller. Decides which process gets the device when and for how much time.</li>
<li><strong>File Management</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Allocates the resources. De-allocates the resource. Decides who gets the resources.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; By means of passwords &amp; similar other techniques, preventing unauthorized access to programs &amp; data.</li>
<li><strong>Error-detecting aids</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Production of dumps, traces, error messages and other debugging and error-detecting methods.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Important functions of an operating System:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />The operating system uses password protection to protect user data and similar other techniques. it also prevents unauthorized access to programs and user data.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Control over system performance &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Monitors overall system health to help improve performance. records the response time between service requests and system response to have a complete view of the system health. This can help improve performance by providing important information needed to troubleshoot problems.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Job accounting &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Operating system Keeps track of time and resources used by various tasks and users, this information can be used to track resource usage for a particular user or group of user.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Error detecting aids &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Operating system constantly monitors the system to detect errors and avoid the malfunctioning of computer system.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Coordination between other software and users &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Operating systems also coordinate and assign interpreters, compilers, assemblers and other software to the various users of the computer systems.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Memory Management &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />The operating system manages the Primary Memory or Main Memory. Main memory is made up of a large array of bytes or words where each byte or word is assigned a certain address. Main memory is a fast storage and it can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a program to be executed, it should be first loaded in the main memory. An Operating System performs the following activities for memory management:&nbsp;
<p>It keeps tracks of primary memory, i.e., which bytes of memory are used by which user program. The memory addresses that have already been allocated and the memory addresses of the memory that has not yet been used. In multi programming, the OS decides the order in which process are granted access to memory, and for how long. It Allocates the memory to a process when the process requests it and deallocates the memory when the process has terminated or is performing an I/O operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Processor Management &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />In a multi programming environment, the OS decides the order in which processes have access to the processor, and how much processing time each process has. This function of OS is called process scheduling. An Operating System performs the following activities for processor management.&nbsp;
<p>Keeps tracks of the status of processes. The program which perform this task is known as traffic controller. Allocates the CPU that is processor to a process. De-allocates processor when a process is no more required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Device Management &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />An OS manages device communication via their respective drivers. It performs the following activities for device management. Keeps tracks of all devices connected to system. designates a program responsible for every device known as the Input/Output controller. Decides which process gets access to a certain device and for how long. Allocates devices in an effective and efficient way. Deallocates devices when they are no longer required.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>File Management &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />A file system is organized into directories for efficient or easy navigation and usage. These directories may contain other directories and other files. An Operating System carries out the following file management activities. It keeps track of where information is stored, user access settings and status of every file and more&hellip; These facilities are collectively known as the file system.&nbsp;</li>
