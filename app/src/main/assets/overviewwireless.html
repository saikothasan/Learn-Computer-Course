<h1 class="entry-title">Wireless Communication:</h1>
<p>Wireless Communication is the fastest growing and most vibrant technological areas in the communication field. Wireless Communication is a method of transmitting information from one point to other, without using any connection like wires, cables or any physical medium.</p>
<p>Generally, in a communication system, information is transmitted from transmitter to receiver that are placed over a limited distance. With the help of Wireless Communication, the transmitter and receiver can be placed anywhere between few meters (like a T.V. Remote Control) to few thousand kilometres (Satellite Communication).</p>
<p>We live in a World of communication and Wireless Communication, in particular is a key part of our lives. Some of the commonly used Wireless Communication Systems in our day &ndash; to &ndash; day life are: Mobile Phones, GPS Receivers, Remote Controls, Bluetooth Audio and Wi-Fi etc.</p>
<h3>What is Wireless Communication?</h3>
<p>Communication Systems can be Wired or Wireless and the medium used for communication can be Guided or Unguided. In Wired Communication, the medium is a physical path like Co-axial Cables, Twisted Pair Cables and Optical Fiber Links etc. which guides the signal to propagate from one point to other.</p>
<p>Such type of medium is called Guided Medium. On the other hand, Wireless Communication doesn&rsquo;t require any physical medium but propagates the signal through space. Since, space only allows for signal transmission without any guidance, the medium used in Wireless Communication is called Unguided Medium.</p>
<p>If there is no physical medium, then how does wireless communication transmit signals? Even though there are no cables used in wireless communication, the transmission and reception of signals is accomplished with Antennas.</p>
<p>Antennas are electrical devices that transform the electrical signals to radio signals in the form of Electromagnetic (EM) Waves and vice versa. These Electromagnetic Waves propagates through space. Hence, both transmitter and receiver consists of an antenna.</p>
<h4>What is Electromagnetic Wave?</h4>
<p>Electromagnetic Waves carry the electromagnetic energy of electromagnetic field through space. Electromagnetic Waves include Gamma Rays (&gamma; &ndash; Rays), X &ndash; Rays, Ultraviolet Rays, Visible Light, Infrared Rays, Microwave Rays and Radio Waves. Electromagnetic Waves (usually Radio Waves) are used in wireless communication to carry the signals.</p>
<p>An Electromagnetic Wave consists of both electric and magnetic fields in the form of time varying sinusoidal waves. Both these fields are oscillating perpendicular to each other and the direction of propagation of the Electromagnetic Wave is again perpendicular to both these fields.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Wireless Communication</h2>
<p>There are numerous advantage of Wireless Communication Technology, Wireless Networking and Wireless Systems over Wired Communication like Cost, Mobility, Ease of Installation, and Reliability etc.</p>
<h4><span id="Cost" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Cost</h4>
<p>The cost of installing wires, cables and other infrastructure is eliminated in wireless communication and hence lowering the overall cost of the system compared to wired communication system. Installing wired network in building, digging up the Earth to lay the cables and running those wires across the streets is extremely difficult, costly and time consuming job.</p>
<p>In historical buildings, drilling holes for cables is not a best idea as it destroys the integrity and importance of the building. Also, in older buildings with no dedicated lines for communication, wireless communication like Wi-Fi or Wireless LAN is the only option.</p>
<h4><span id="Mobility" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Mobility</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, mobility is the main advantage of wireless communication system. It offers the freedom to move around while still connected to network.</p>
<h4><span id="Ease_of_Installation" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Ease of Installation</h4>
<p>The setup and installation of wireless communication network&rsquo;s equipment and infrastructure is very easy as we need not worry about the hassle of cables. Also, the time required to setup a wireless system like a Wi-Fi network for example, is very less when compared to setting up a full cabled network.</p>
<h4><span id="Reliability" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Reliability</h4>
<p>Since there are no cables and wires involved in wireless communication, there is no chance of communication failure due to damage of these cables which may be caused by environmental conditions, cable splice and natural diminution of metallic conductors.</p>
<h4><span id="Disaster_Recovery" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Disaster Recovery</h4>
<p>In case of accidents due to fire, floods or other disasters, the loss of communication infrastructure in wireless communication system can be minimal.</p>
<h2><span id="Disadvantages_of_Wireless_Communication" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Disadvantages of Wireless Communication</h2>
<p>Even though wireless communication has a number of advantages over wired communication, there are a few disadvantages as well. The most concerning disadvantages are Interference, Security and Health.</p>
<h4><span id="Interference" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Interference</h4>
<p>Wireless Communication systems use open space as the medium for transmitting signals. As a result, there is a huge chance that radio signals from one wireless communication system or network might interfere with other signals.</p>
<p>The best example is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (WLAN). Both these technologies use the 2.4GHz frequency for communication and when both of these devices are active at the same time, there is a chance of interference.</p>
<h4><span id="Security" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Security</h4>
<p>One of the main concerns of wireless communication is Security of the data. Since the signals are transmitted in open space, it is possible that an intruder can intercept the signals and copy sensitive information.</p>
<h4><span id="Health_Concerns" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Health Concerns</h4>
<p>Continuous exposure to any type of radiation can be hazardous. Even though the levels of RF energy that can cause the damage are not accurately established, it is advised to avoid RF radiation to the maximum.</p>
<h2>Basic Elements of a Wireless Communication System</h2>
<p>A typical Wireless Communication System can be divided into three elements: the Transmitter, the Channel and the Receiver.</p>
<h4>The Transmission Path</h4>
<p>A typical transmission path of a Wireless Communication System consists of Encoder, Encryption, Modulation and Multiplexing. The signal from the source is passed through a Source Encoder, which converts the signal in to a suitable form for applying signal processing techniques.</p>
<p>The redundant information from signal is removed in this process in order to maximise the utilization of resources. This signal is then encrypted using an Encryption Standard so that the signal and the information is secured and doesn&rsquo;t allow any unauthorised access.</p>
<p>Channel Encoding is a technique that is applied to the signal to reduce the impairments like noise, interference, etc. During this process, a small amount of redundancy is introduced to the signal so that it becomes robust against noise. Then the signal is modulated using a suitable Modulation Technique (like PSK, FSK and QPSK etc.) , so that the signal can be easily transmitted using antenna.</p>
<p>The modulated signal is then multiplexed with other signals using different Multiplexing Techniques like Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) or Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) to share the valuable bandwidth.</p>
<h4><span id="The_Channel" class="ez-toc-section"></span>The Channel</h4>
<p>The channel in Wireless Communication indicates the medium of transmission of the signal i.e. open space. A wireless channel is unpredictable and also highly variable and random in nature. A channel maybe subject to interference, distortion, noise, scattering etc. and the result is that the received signal may be filled with errors.</p>
<h4><span id="The_Reception_Path" class="ez-toc-section"></span>The Reception Path</h4>
<p>The job of the Receiver is to collect the signal from the channel and reproduce it as the source signal. The reception path of a Wireless Communication System comprises of Demultiplexing , Demodulation, Channel Decoding, Decryption and Source Decoding. From the components of the reception path it is clear that the task of the receiver is just the inverse to that of transmitter.</p>
<p>The signal from the channel is received by the Demultiplexer and is separated from other signals. The individual signals are demodulated using appropriate Demodulation Techniques and the original message signal is recovered. The redundant bits from the message are removed using the Channel Decoder.</p>
<p>Since the message is encrypted, Decryption of the signal removes the security and turns it into simple sequence of bits. Finally, this signal is given to the Source Decoder to get back the original transmitted message or signal.</p>
<h2><span id="Types_of_Wireless_Communication_Systems" class="ez-toc-section"></span>Types of Wireless Communication Systems</h2>
<p>Today, people need Mobile Phones for many things like talking, internet, multimedia etc. All these services must be made available to the user on the go i.e. while the user is mobile. With the help of these wireless communication services, we can transfer voice, data, videos, images etc.</p>
<p>Wireless Communication Systems also provide different services like video conferencing, cellular telephone, paging, TV, Radio etc. Due to the need for variety of communication services, different types of Wireless Communication Systems are developed. Some of the important Wireless Communication Systems available today are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

</ul>
<p>There are many other system with each being useful for different applications. Wireless Communication systems can be again classified as Simplex, Half Duplex and Full Duplex. Simplex communication is one way communication. An example is Radio broadcast system.</p>
<p>Half Duplex is two way communication but not simultaneous one. An example is walkie &ndash; talkie (civilian band radio). Full Duplex is also two way communication and it is a simultaneous one. Best example for full duplex is mobile phones.</p>
<p>The devices used for Wireless Communication may vary from one service to other and they may have different size, shape, data throughput and cost. The area covered by a Wireless Communication system is also an important factor. The wireless networks may be limited to a building, an office campus, a city, a small regional area (greater than a city) or might have global coverage.</p>
