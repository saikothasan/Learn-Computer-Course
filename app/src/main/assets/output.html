<h1>Output Devices</h1>
<p>There are several output devices that are as follows:</p>
<h2>Monitor</h2>
<p>This is the most common&nbsp;computer&nbsp;output&nbsp;device. It creates a visual display by the use of which users can view processed data.&nbsp; Monitors come in various sizes and resolutions.</p>
<p>Common Types of Monitors</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Cathode Ray Tube &ndash; this uses phosphorescent dots to generate the pixels that constitute displayed images.</li>
<li>Flat Panel Screen &ndash; this makes use of liquid crystals or plasma to produce output. Light is passed through the liquid crystals in order to generate pixels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Printer</h2>
<p>This device generates a hard copy version of processed data, like documents and photographs. The&nbsp;computer&nbsp;transmits the image data to the&nbsp;printer, which then physically recreates the image, typically on paper.</p>
<p>Types of Printers</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Ink Jet &ndash; this kind of printer sprays tiny dots of ink onto a surface to form an image.</li>
<li>Laser &ndash; this type utilises toner drums that roll through magnetized pigment, and then transfers the pigment onto a surface.</li>
<li>Dot Matrix &ndash; dot matrix printers utilise a print head to set images on a surface, using an ink ribbon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>speakers are attached to computers to facilitate the output of sound; sound cards are required in the computer for speakers to function. The different kinds of speakers range from simple, two-speaker output devices right the way up to surround-sound multi-channel units.</p>
<h2>Headset</h2>
<p>This is a combination of speakers and microphone.&nbsp; It is mostly used by gamers, and is also a great tool for communicating with family and friends over the internet using some VOIP program or other.</p>
<h2>Projector</h2>
<p>&nbsp;This is a display&nbsp;device&nbsp;that projects a computer-created image onto another surface: usually some sort of whiteboard or wall. The&nbsp;computer transmits the image data to its&nbsp;video card, which then sends the video image to the&nbsp;projector. It is most often used for presentations, or for viewing videos.</p>
