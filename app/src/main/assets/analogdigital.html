<h1>Analog Computer and Digital Computer</h1>
<h2><strong>1. Analog Computer :</strong></h2>
<p><br />Analog computer system is the very old computer system which operates on the mathematical variables in the form of continuously changeable physical quantities/entities like mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, etc. They use continuous values rather than discrete values so they work on analog signal. At the time of at the time of the 1950s&ndash;1960s these analog computers were first used. Analog computers are limited in accepting the problems and also they can never be extremely accurate.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Digital Computer :</strong></h2>
<p><br />Digital computers are the computer systems/machines which uses the binary number system, which has two digits: 0 and 1 and performs many computational tasks. It processes the data represented in discrete and the main three components of digital computers are input, processing and output. The first digital computer was designed for numerical computations in the late 1940s. Digital computers give results with more accuracy as it is not dependent upon physical quantities for processing a task.</p>
