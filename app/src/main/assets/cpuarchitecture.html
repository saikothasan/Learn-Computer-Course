<h1>Computer architecture</h1>
<p>In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.</p>
<h1>Von Neumann Architecture</h1>
<p>Von Neumann architecture was first&nbsp;published by&nbsp;John von Neumann in 1945.</p>
<p>His computer&nbsp;architecture design consists&nbsp;of a&nbsp;Control Unit, Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), Memory Unit, Registers&nbsp;and Inputs/Outputs.</p>
<p>Von Neumann architecture is based on the&nbsp;stored-program computer concept, where instruction data and program data are stored in the same memory. &nbsp;This design is still used in most&nbsp;computers produced today.</p>
<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
<p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU)&nbsp;is the electronic circuit responsible for executing the instructions of a computer program.</p>
<p>It is sometimes referred to as the microprocessor or processor.</p>

<p>The CPU contains the ALU, CU and a variety of registers.</p>
<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>Registers are high speed storage areas in the CPU. &nbsp;All data must be stored in a register&nbsp;before it can be processed.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>MAR</th>
<td>Memory Address Register</td>
<td>Holds the memory location of data that needs to be accessed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>MDR</th>
<td>Memory Data Register</td>
<td>Holds data&nbsp;that is being transferred to or from&nbsp;memory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>AC</th>
<td>Accumulator</td>
<td>Where intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>PC</th>
<td>Program Counter</td>
<td>Contains the address of the next instruction to be executed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>CIR</th>
<td>Current Instruction register</td>
<td>Contains the current instruction during processing</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
<p>The ALU allows arithmetic (add, subtract etc) and logic (AND, OR, NOT etc) operations to be carried out.</p>
<h3>Control Unit (CU)</h3>
<p>The control unit controls the operation of the computer&rsquo;s ALU, memory and input/output devices, telling them how to respond to the program instructions it has just read and interpreted from the memory unit.</p>
<p>The control unit&nbsp;also provides the timing and control signals required by other computer components.</p>
<h2>Buses</h2>
<p>Buses are the means by which&nbsp;data is transmitted from one part of a computer to another, connecting all major internal components to the CPU and memory.</p>
<p>A standard CPU system bus&nbsp;is comprised of a control bus,data bus and address bus.&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Address Bus</th>
<td>Carries the&nbsp;addresses of data (but not the data) between the processor and memory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Data Bus</th>
<td>Carries&nbsp;data between the processor, the memory unit and the input/output devices</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Control Bus</th>
<td>Carries control signals/commands from the CPU (and status signals from other devices) in order&nbsp;to&nbsp;control and coordinate&nbsp;all the activities within the computer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Memory Unit</h2>
<p>The memory unit consists of RAM, sometimes referred to as primary or main memory. &nbsp;Unlike a hard drive (secondary memory), this memory is fast and also directly accessible by the CPU.</p>
<p>RAM is split into&nbsp;partitions. &nbsp;Each partition consists of an address and its contents (both in binary&nbsp;form).</p>
<p>The address will uniquely identify every location in the memory.</p>
<p>Loading data from permanent memory (hard drive), into the faster and directly accessible temporary memory (RAM), allows the CPU&nbsp;to operate much quicker.</p>
