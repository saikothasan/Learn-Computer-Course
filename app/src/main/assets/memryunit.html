<h1>Memory Units</h1>
<p><strong>Memory unit</strong>&nbsp;is the amount of data that can be stored in the storage&nbsp;<strong>unit</strong>. This storage capacity is expressed in terms of Bytes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There are two types of memory:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Read only memory (ROM):-&nbsp;</strong>ROM is a part of the memory unit. This is read only memory. It can not be used to written. ROM is used in situations where the data must be held permanently.</li>
<li><strong>Random access memory (RAM):-&nbsp;</strong>RAM is also part of memory unit. It is used for temporary storage of program data. Its data is lost when power is turned off.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Memory Unit</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>Memory Unit</strong>&nbsp;is a collection of storage cells together with associated circuits needed to transfer information in and out of storage.</p>
<h3>Word</h3>
<p>The memory stores&nbsp;<strong>binary information(1's and 0's)</strong>&nbsp;in groups of&nbsp;<strong>bits</strong>&nbsp;called&nbsp;<strong>words</strong>. A word in memory is an entity of bits that move in and out of storage as a unit. A memory word is a group of 1's and 0's and may represent a number, an instruction code, one or more alphanumeric characters, or any other binary coded information.</p>
<h3>Byte</h3>
<p>A group of&nbsp;<strong>eight bits</strong>&nbsp;is called a&nbsp;<strong>byte</strong>. Most computer memories use words whose number of bits is a multiple of 8. Thus a 16-bit word contains two bytes, and a 32-bit word is made up of 4 bytes.</p>
<p>The capacity of memories in commercial computers is usually stated as the total number of bytes that can be stored.</p>
<h2>Internal Structure of a Memory Unit</h2>
<p>The internal structure of a memory unit is specified by the&nbsp;<strong>number of words</strong>&nbsp;it contains and the&nbsp;<strong>number of bits</strong>&nbsp;in each word. Special input lines called&nbsp;<strong>address lines</strong>&nbsp;select one particular word. Each word in memory is assigned an identification number, called an&nbsp;<strong>address</strong>, staring from 0 and continuing with 1, 2, 3, up to&nbsp;<strong>2<sup>k</sup>&nbsp;- 1</strong>&nbsp;where&nbsp;<strong>k</strong>&nbsp;is the number of address lines. The selection of a specific word inside the memory is done by applying the k-bit binary address to the address lines.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>decoder</strong>&nbsp;inside the memory accepts this address and opens the paths needed to select the bits of the specified word.</p>
<p>Computer memories may range from 1024 words, requiring an address of 10 bits, to 2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;words, requiring 32 address bits. It is customary to refer to the number of words(or bytes) in a memory with one of the letters:</p>
<ul class="content" style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>K(Kilo)</strong>&nbsp;is equal to 2<sup>10</sup></li>
<li><strong>M(Mega)</strong>&nbsp;is equal to 2<sup>20</sup></li>
<li><strong>G(Giga)</strong>&nbsp;is equal to 2<sup>30</sup></li>
</ul>
