<h1 class="">About the Broadcast Slide Show feature</h1>
<h2 class="">How can I broadcast a slide show myself?</h2>
<p>If you have PowerPoint 2010 and a hosted broadcast service provided by your organization, you can broadcast a slide show of your own. A Windows Live ID can be used with the Microsoft PowerPoint Broadcast Service in&nbsp;PowerPoint 2013 and later.</p>
<p>To broadcast your own slide show, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Open PowerPoint.</p>
<div class="ocpAlert">
<p class="ocpAlertSection"><strong class="ocpNote">Important:</strong>&nbsp;You must have PowerPoint 2010 or later to use this feature.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the slide show that you want to broadcast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Slide Show</strong>&nbsp;tab, in the&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Start Slide Show</strong>&nbsp;group, click&nbsp;<strong class="ocpUI">Broadcast Slide Show</strong>.</p>
