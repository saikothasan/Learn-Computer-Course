<h1>Open-source software:</h1>
<p>Open-source software is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-5" class="comp text-passage mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Open Source Initiative (OSI), a global nonprofit founded in 1998, acts as a leading authority on OSS. Its definition of open-source software includes ten criteria, relating to matters such as:</p>
<ul id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-8" class="comp text-passage mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">
<li>Software redistribution</li>
<li>Source code availability and integrity</li>
<li>Distribution and properties of licenses</li>
<li>Derived works</li>
<li>Anti-discrimination</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="title "><span class="text-size-normal">How does OSS work?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="component-text">
<p>Open source code is usually stored in a public repository and shared publicly. Anyone can access the repository to use the code independently or contribute improvements to the design and functionality of the overall project.</p>
<p>OSS usually comes with a distribution license. This license includes terms that define how developers can use, study, modify, and most importantly, distribute the software.According to the Synopsy&nbsp;&nbsp;five of the most popular licenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>MIT License</li>
<li>GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0&mdash;this is more restrictive and requires that copies of modified code are made available for public use</li>
<li>Apache License 2.0</li>
<li>GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0</li>
<li>BSD License 2.0 (3-clause, New or Revised)&mdash;this is less restrictive</li>
</ul>
<div>When source code is changed, OSS must include what was altered as well as the methods involved. Depending on the license terms, the software resulting from these modifications may or may not be required to be made available for free.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Open source software is free.</li>
<li>Open source is flexible; developers can examine how the code works and freely make changes to dysfunctional or problematic aspects of the application to better fit their unique needs.</li>
<li>Open source is stable; the source code is publicly distributed, so users can depend on it for their long-term projects since they know that the code&rsquo;s creators cannot simply discontinue the project or let it fall into disrepair.</li>
<li>Open source fosters ingenuity; programmers can use pre-existing code to improve the software and even come up with their own innovations.</li>
<li>Open source comes with a built-in community that continuously modifies and improves the source code.</li>
<li>Open source provides great learning opportunities for new programmers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Open source can be harder to use and adopt due to difficulty setting it up and the lack of friendly user interfaces.</li>
<li>Open source can pose compatibility issues. When attempting to program proprietary hardware with OSS, there is often a need for specialized drivers that are typically only available from the hardware manufacturer. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Open source software can pose liability issues. Unlike commercial software, which is fully controlled by the vendor, open source rarely contains any warranty, liability, or infringement indemnity protection. This leaves the consumer of the OSS responsible for maintaining compliance with legal obligations.</li>
<li>Open source can incur unexpected costs in training users, importing data, and setting up required hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Freeware</h2>
<p>Loosely defined as a type of proprietary software, that it&rsquo;s being distributed at no cost whatsoever for the user, freeware is the answer to accomplishing very simple tasks without the need of investing in expensive, license-based software. Freeware software has no EULA, license, or rights of any kind, which means that it can be deployed on both home and enterprise machines.</p>
<p>Freeware is not a modern concoction. In fact, the term itself was coined in the golden 80s by Andrew Fluegelman, who sough of means of making&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-Talk" rel="noopener">PC-Talk</a>&nbsp;(Skype&rsquo;s long-forgotten ancestors) available outside regular distribution channels. The key differentiator between freeware, shareware, and open-source is that freeware does not make its source code available, despite being free of charge.</p>
<p>A couple of freeware examples: Discord (IM used by the gaming community), Yahoo Messenger (rest in peace, my friend), &micro;Torrent, IrfanView, Groove Music, Winamp, DVD Shrink, CCleaner, and others.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Easy to use and deploy (for home users and enterprises\SMBs).</li>
<li>A great way to incentivize your potential customers (for soft makers and marketeers gunning for paid licenses).</li>
<li>Solve daily tasks without having to invest in expensive software.</li>
<li>Quickly grow your user base.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Limited functionality.</li>
<li>No way of reverse-engineering it since the source code is not made available.</li>
<li>Customers may sometimes perceive the product as inferior.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shareware</h2>
<p>Probably most of the apps found online and offline fall under this category. Shareware is so widespread that it &lsquo;felt&rsquo; the need to have its own consortium. Called the Association of shareware professional&nbsp;or ASP, for short, this international trading and trade organization comprises over 1,500 vendors, authors, and online retailers. The term was coined around the same time as freeware.</p>
<p>While Fluegelman was pushing his PC-Talk comm app. Jim &ldquo;Button&rdquo; Knopf, an IBM employee at that time, was releasing a database program called PC-File. In legal terms, the main difference between Knopf&rsquo;s apps and Fluegelman&rsquo;s freebie is that the database program was never meant to be offered free of charge.</p>
<p>Knopf himself called his creation &ldquo;user-supported software&rdquo; meaning that users would need to cover some of the fees associated with the continual development of the product. No doubt, an interesting marketing praxis, but a lucrative one, given shareware&rsquo;s popularity and availability.</p>
<p>Shareware is an umbrella term, encompassing various types of apps, each following a unique business model.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Free to use.</li>
<li>Powerful feature. Great for getting a one-time task done.</li>
<li>Donationware is just as good as any license-based application.</li>
<li>Diversity and abundance.</li>
<li>Most of them are cross-platformers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Some legal issues may arise if deployed on enterprise machines.</li>
<li>Poor compatibility with newer operating systems.</li>
<li>Ads and nags can become annoying.</li>
<li>Shareware doesn&rsquo;t benefit from regular security and functionality updates as licensed software.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last thing to mention &ndash; neither freeware nor shareware authors don&rsquo;t make the software code available for studying or altering. Which brings us to the third software category: open-source.</p>
