<h1>WAN</h1>
<p>A wide area network (also known as WAN), is a large network of information that is not tied to a single location. WANs can facilitate communication, the sharing of information and much more between devices from around the world through a WAN provider.</p>
<p>WANs can be vital for international businesses, but they are also essential for everyday use, as the internet is considered the largest WAN in the world. Keep reading for more information on WANs, their use, how they differ from other networks and their overall purpose for businesses and people, alike.</p>

<h2>What Is a Wide Area Network (WAN)?</h2>
<p>As described above, wide area networks are a form of telecommunication networks that can connect devices from multiple locations and across the globe. WANs are the largest and most expansive forms of computer networks available to date.</p>
<p>These networks are often established by service providers that then lease their WAN to businesses, schools, governments or the public. These customers can use the network to relay and store data or communicate with other users, no matter their location, as long as they have access to the established WAN. Access can be granted via different links, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or lines, wireless networks, cellular networks or internet access.</p>
<p>For international organizations, WANs allow them to carry out their essential daily functions without delay. Employees from anywhere can use a business&rsquo;s WAN to share data, communicate with coworkers or simply stay connected to the greater data resource center for that organization. Certified Network Professionals&nbsp;help organizations maintain their internal wide area network, as well as other critical IT infrastructure.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s the Difference Between Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN)?</h3>
<p>There are many different forms of area networks, but one of the most common networks outside of WANs is the local area network, or LAN.</p>
<p>Whereas WANs can exist globally, without ties to a physical location through the use of a leased network provider, LANs exist within a limited area. LANs can be used to access a greater WAN (such as the internet), but only within the area where the LAN&rsquo;s infrastructure can reach.</p>
<p>Two common examples of LANs are ethernet and wireless networks. Wireless LANs are also known as WLANs. Other forms of telecommunication networks include the following:</p>
<ul class="bulletlist">
<li>Personal area networks (PAN)</li>
<li>Metropolitan area networks (MAN)</li>
<li>Cloud or Internet Area Networks(IAN)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Is the Purpose of a WAN Connection?</h3>
<p>If WAN connections didn&rsquo;t exist, organizations would be isolated to restricted areas or specific geographic regions. LANs would allow organizations to work within their building, but growth to outside areas &mdash; either different cities or even different countries &mdash; would not be possible because the associated infrastructure would be cost prohibitive for most organizations.</p>
<p>As organizations grow and become international, WANs allow them to communicate between branches, share information and stay connected. When employees travel for work, WANs allow them to access the information they need to do their job. WANs also help organizations share information with customers, as well as partner organizations, such as B2B clients or customers.</p>
<p>However, WANs also provide an essential service to the public. Students at universities might rely on WANs to access library databases or university research. And every day, people rely on WANs to communicate, bank, shop and more.</p>
<h2><strong>Advantages of a wide area network (WAN)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Covers large geographical area:</strong></p>
<p>Wan covers a large geographical area of 1000 km or more If your office is in different cities or countries then you can connect your office branches through wan. ISP (Internet service provider) can give you leased lines by which you can connect different branch offices together.</p>
<p><strong>Centralized data:</strong></p>
<p>Your company doesn&rsquo;t need to buy email, files, and backup servers, they can all reside on head office. All office branches can share the data through the head office server. You can get back up, support, and other useful data from the head office and all data are synchronized with all other office branches.</p>
<p><strong>Get updated files and data:</strong></p>
<p>Software companies work over the live server to exchange updated files. So all the coders and office staff get updated version of files within seconds.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of application to exchange messages:</strong></p>
<p>With IOT (Internet of things) and new LAN technologies, messages are being transmitted fast. A lot of web applications are available like Facebook messenger, WhatsApp, Skype by which you can communicate with friends via text, voice and video chat.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of software and resources:</strong></p>
<p>Like LAN we can share software applications and other resources like a hard drive, RAM with other users on the internet. In web hosting, we share computer resources among many websites.</p>
<p><strong>Global business:</strong></p>
<p>Now everyone with computer skills can do business on the internet and expand his business globally. There are many types of business like a shopping cart, sale, and purchase of stocks etc.</p>
<p><strong>High bandwidth:</strong></p>
<p>If you get leased lines for your company then it gives high bandwidth than normal broadband connection. You can get a high data transfer rate that can increase your company productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Distribute workload and decrease travel charges:</strong></p>
<p>Another benefit of wide area network is that you can distribute your work to other locations. For example, you have an office in the U.S then you can hire people from any other country and communicate with them easily over WAN. It also reduces your travel charges as you can monitor the activities of your team online.</p>
<h2><strong>Disadvantages of a wide area network (WAN)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Security problems:</strong></p>
<p>WAN has more security problem as compare to MAN and LAN. WAN has many technologies combined with each other which can create a security gap.</p>
<p><strong>Needs firewall and antivirus software:</strong></p>
<p>As data transferred on the internet can be accessed and changed by hackers so firewall needs to be enabled in the computer. Some people can also inject a virus into the computer so antivirus software needs to be installed. Other security software also needs to be installed on different points in WAN.</p>
<p><strong>The setup cost is high:</strong></p>
<p>Setting up WAN for the first time in office costs higher money. It may involve purchasing routers, switches, and extra security software.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting problems:</strong></p>
<p>As WAN covers a lot of areas so fixing the problem in it is difficult. Most of WAN wires go into the sea and wires get broken sometimes. It involves a lot of resources to fix lines under the sea. In ISP (Internet service provider) head office many of internet lines, routers are mixed up in rooms and fixing issues on the internet requires a full-time staff.</p>
<p><strong>Server down and disconnection issue:</strong></p>
<p>In some areas, ISP faces problems due to electricity supply or bad lines structure. Customers often face connectivity issues or slow Internet speed issues. The solution to this is to purchase a dedicated line from ISP.</p>
