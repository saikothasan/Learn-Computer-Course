<p>Stay on track with the latest security requirements by checking off all the items on this list.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. I use anti-virus &amp; anti-malware software.</h2>

<p>Use the University recommended free anti-virus (Sophos Intercept X with EDR) and anti-malware software to run a full scan of your computer at least once a month. Make sure you have the latest version of the software, your virus definitions are set to update automatically, and on-access scanning is enabled. Beware of fake anti-virus software and other rogue programs. Always download software from reputable sources.</p>
<h2>2. My operating system is updated.</h2>

<h2>5. I protect myself against phishing scams &amp; identity theft</h2>
<p>Never provide passwords or other sensitive information in response to an email or enter them on an untrusted site.</p>
<h2>6. I clear my private data from Web browsers.</h2>
<div class="sectionBody">
<p>Web browsers often store information from Web sites you visit (e.g., cookies). Clear this information often, especially if you use a public or shared computer, or set up your browser to do it automatically. Check the browser&rsquo;s help for instructions. Never save passwords in a Web browser.</p>
<h2>7. I create strong passwords.</h2>
<div class="sectionBody">
<p>Your&nbsp;IT&nbsp;Account password should be different from your other passwords. Build your passwords using UMass IT&rsquo;s Rules for passwords&nbsp;and remember to change them quarterly.</p>
<h2>8. I use a password-protected lock screen.</h2>
<div class="sectionBody">
<p>'Locking' the screen or using a password-protected screen saver allows you to lock your computer without shutting it down when stepping away from your desk. Press the Windows key + L to lock your Windows computer. To protect your cell phone data, enable a passcode and set it to auto-lock.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. I only download software from reputable sources.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Malware, which includes viruses, spyware, adware, and other malicious software, is often disguised as, or bundled with, legitimate software. Only download software from sources that you trust. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. My firewall is turned on.</h2>
