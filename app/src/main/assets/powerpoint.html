<p><strong>PowerPoint</strong>&nbsp;is an excellent tool for presentations of any kind, either in the classroom or at a conference. A PowerPoint presentation is made up of a series of&nbsp;<em>slides</em>&nbsp;that can be projected (displayed electronically) or printed in a variety of handout formats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PowerPoint can be used for making conference posters &mdash;&nbsp;and many people do use it successfully &mdash; but we&nbsp;consider Adobe Illustrator&nbsp;a superior tool for this purpose&nbsp;as it is designed for creating high-quality print documents, whereas PowerPoint is designed for viewing on a computer or as a projected image.</p>

<p>When you open PowerPoint, a new presentation is created with a Title Slide in place.&nbsp; To add a new slide, go to the Home Ribbon.</p>
<p><img src="gettingpowerpoint.png" alt="new slide" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the&nbsp;<em>icon</em>&nbsp;for new slide to insert a new slide with a&nbsp;duplicate layout as the current one selected in the&nbsp;presentation.</li>
<li>Click on the&nbsp;<em>text</em>&nbsp;<strong>New Slide</strong>&nbsp;to select any layout, duplicate&nbsp;from what&rsquo;s selected, or reuse slides from a different&nbsp;presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new slide will be added after the currently selected slide.</p>
<p><strong>Move between your slides</strong>&nbsp;by clicking on the appropriate slide icon in the left sidebar, or use the double arrows at the bottom of the right scrollbar.</p>
<h2>Changing the Slide Layout</h2>
<p>You can always change the layout by going to the Home Ribbon and clicking on the&nbsp;Layout&nbsp;icon.&nbsp; If content is already on the slide, you may need to move things around a little.</p>

<p>To play your presentation, go to the Presentation tab and click "Play from Start" (Keyboard option: hold down Control-Shift and press Enter). Advance through your presentation by pressing the Spacebar or right arrow key&nbsp;on the keyboard. To go back a slide, use either the left or up arrow key on your keyboard. In PowerPoint you can navigate directly to any slide by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click anywhere on the slide, and choose&nbsp;<strong>By Title</strong>&nbsp;from the shortcut menu.</li>
<li>Click on the appropriate slide. If the slide doesn&rsquo;t have a title, it will say&nbsp;<strong>Slide #</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of a list, PowerPoint gives you the option to see all of the slides as thumbnails while in the slideshow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click anywhere on the slide, and choose&nbsp;<strong>See All Slides</strong>&nbsp;from the shortcut menu.</li>
<li>Click on the thumbnail of the slide you would like to go to. PowerPoint will automatically restart the presentation from that slide.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To exit your presentation (and return to the editing view), press the&nbsp;<em>esc</em>&nbsp;key on the keyboard.</p>
