<h1>Secondary Memory</h1>
<p>All secondary storage devices which are capable of storing high volume data is referred to secondary memory. It's slower than primary memory. However, it can save a substantial amount of data, in the range of gigabytes to terabytes. This memory is also called backup storage or mass storage media.</p>
<h2>Types of Secondary memory</h2>
<h3>Mass storage devices:</h3>
<p>The magnetic disk provides cheap storage and is used for both small and large computer systems.</p>
<p>Two types of magnetic disks are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Floppy disks</li>
<li>Hard disks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flash/SSD</h3>
<p>Solid State Drive provides a persistent flash memory. It's very fast compared to Hard Drives. Frequently found in Mobile phones, its rapidly being adopted in PC/Laptop/Mac.</p>
<h3>Optical drives:</h3>
<p>This secondary storage device is from which data is read and written with the help of lasers. Optical disks can hold data up to 185TB.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>CD</li>
<li>DVD</li>
<li>Blue Ray</li>
</ul>
<h3>USB drives:</h3>
<p>It is one of the most popular types of secondary storage device available in the market. USB drives are removable, rewritable and are physically very small. The capacity of USB drives is also increasing significantly as today 1TB pen drive is also available in the market.</p>
<h3>Magnetic tape:</h3>
<p>It is a serial access storage device which allows us to store a very high volume of data. Usually used for backups.</p>
