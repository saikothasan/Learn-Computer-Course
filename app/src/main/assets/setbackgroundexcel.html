<h1 class="">Add or remove a sheet background</h1>
<p>In Microsoft Excel, you can use a picture as a sheet background for display purposes only. A sheet background is not printed, and it is not retained in an individual worksheet or in an item that you save as a Web page.</p>
<p>Because a sheet background is not printed, it cannot be used as a watermark. However, you can mimic a watermark that will be printed by inserting a graphic in a header or footer.</p>
