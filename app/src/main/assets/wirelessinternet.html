<h1>Internet</h1>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Internet</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>internet</strong>) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the&nbsp;<strong>Internet</strong>&nbsp;protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.</p>
<h2>Types of Internet Connections</h2>
<p>Modern technology has come a long way, especially in the last few years. There is a lot that we can do that seemed impossible just a decade or two, like instantly connecting with people all over the world, and your options for doing so are growing every day.

<h2>Dial-Up</h2>
<p>At the inception of the internet, dial-up was your only possible connection. Your computer dials a phone number to give you access to the World Wide Web, which comes with some obvious problems. The biggest issue for most has been the fact that you can&rsquo;t make or receive phone calls while someone is using the computer. Many adults today can probably remember being pulled away from the keyboard so their parents could use the phone. Such a problem probably would never even occur to most kids now, and that&rsquo;s because many have moved away from dial-up internet. It may be cheap, but it is slow and ineffective.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of rural Texas, dial-up may be one of the few internet service connections available to you, which is why Clarus Broadband is working so hard with local communities in Belton, Copperas Cove, Gatesville, and more to give you better options. Learn how you can become a champion and bring better internet service to your town today!</p>
<h2>Satellite</h2>
<p>Satellite internet is another option often available where broadband &ndash; which we will discuss in a moment &ndash; is not, which means it is another one of the more common connection types used in rural areas. As you might expect, satellite internet offers your computer a connection by communicating with a satellite orbiting Earth. It requires a satellite dish with a clear line-of-sight, which is just one drawback. Another major problem you may face? The signal from your satellite dish has to travel a long way &ndash; thousands of miles &ndash; which is why the connection can be delayed when compared to broadband. It can provide high-speed internet, but it&rsquo;s not a great option for online gaming or video streaming, because you share bandwidth with other people in the area.</p>
<h2>Broadband</h2>
<p>The term &ldquo;broadband&rdquo; is shorthand for &ldquo;broad bandwidth,&rdquo; and it offers significantly better high-speed connections than dial-up. However, you should know that the word &ldquo;broadband&rdquo; is often used to describe a wide variety of internet connection types, and not always in a way that is technically correct. For our purposes in this article, we are going to use it in its more general sense and then explain more specific connection types that may be categorized under &ldquo;broadband&rdquo;, correctly or incorrectly.</p>
<h3>DSL</h3>
<p>DSL stands for &ldquo;digital subscriber line&rdquo; and in its simplest form, it can be explained as a better, more high-tech version of dial-up internet. It still uses phone lines to connect, but it uses two lines and leaves room for you to continue to make and receive calls. It is a significantly faster and higher quality internet connection when compared to dial-up.</p>
<h3>Cable</h3>
<p>Rather than phone lines, cable internet operates over &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; cable TV lines. Cable internet offers greater bandwidth than DSL, and therefore faster access. Speed can depend on how you use your access, however, and whether you are uploading or downloading any files.</p>
<h3>Wireless</h3>
<p>The abbreviation &ldquo;WiFi&rdquo; has almost become synonymous with &ldquo;internet&rdquo; these days, but it refers to a specific kind of internet connection that utilizes radio frequencies rather than phone or cable lines. It&rsquo;s always on, and it can be access from anywhere within network range. It&rsquo;s one of the fastest options on the market.</p>
<h2>Fiber Optics</h2>
<p>When you want the best of the best internet connections, you want fiber optics. Fiber optics have tapped into an innovative and relatively new way to transmit signals using light conveyed through cables made of a special, flexible plastic or glass. Nothing in the universe travels as fast as light, which is one of the reasons why fiber optics offers such blisteringly fast internet speeds. It&rsquo;s a great option for houses with multiple devices in use and the speed of your connection is unaffected by your neighbors&rsquo; internet use, which is not something many other types of internet service can claim.</p>
