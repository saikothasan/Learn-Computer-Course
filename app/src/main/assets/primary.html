<h1>Primary Memory</h1>
<p><strong>Primary memory</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>computer memory</strong>&nbsp;that is accessed directly by the CPU.<strong>RAM</strong>, or random access&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>, consists of one or more&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>&nbsp;modules that temporarily store data while a&nbsp;<strong>computer</strong>&nbsp;is running.</p>
<p><strong>Primary memory</strong>&nbsp;is also known as Main&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>&nbsp;or Internal&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>RAM</strong>&nbsp;is volatile&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>, meaning it is erased when the power is turned off.</p>
<h2>Characteristic of Primary Memory</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The computer can't run without primary memory</li>
<li>It is known as the main memory.</li>
<li>You can lose data in case power is switched off</li>
<li>It is also known as volatile memory</li>
<li>It is a working memory of the computer.</li>
<li>Primary memory is faster compares to secondary memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Two Types of Primary Memory are:</strong></h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>RAM</strong></li>
<li><strong>ROM</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>RAM</strong></h2>
<p>The full form of RAM is Random Access Memory. The information stored in this type of memory is lost when the power supply to the PC or laptop is switched off. The information stored in RAM can be checked with the help of BIOS. It is generally known as the main memory or temporary memory or cache memory or volatile memory of the computer system.</p>
<p>Two main types of RAM are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static RAM</li>
<li>Dynamic RAM</li>
</ul>
<h3>Static RAM</h3>
<p>Static RAM is the full form of SRAM. In this type of RAM, data is stored using the state of a six transistor memory cell. Static RAM is mostly used as a cache memory for the processor (CPU).</p>
<h3>Dynamic RAM</h3>
<p>DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is a type of RAM which allows you to stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within a specific integrated circuit. Dynamic RAM is a standard computer memory of the many modern desktop computers.</p>
<p>This type of RAM is a volatile memory that needs to be refreshed with voltage regularly. Else it loses the information stored on it.</p>
<h2>Uses of RAM</h2>
<p>Here, are important uses of RAM:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>RAM is utilized in the computer as a scratchpad, buffer, and main memory.</li>
<li>It offers a fast operating speed.</li>
<li>It is also popular for its compatibility</li>
<li>It offers low power dissipation</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>ROM</strong></h2>
<p>ROM&nbsp;(read only memory) is a flash memory chip that contains a small amount of non-volatile memory. Non-volatile means that its contents cannot be changed and it retains its memory after the&nbsp;computer&nbsp;is turned off.</p>
<h3>Types of ROM</h3>
<p><strong>PROM</strong>: Programmable ROM, or PROM, is essentially a blank version of ROM that you can purchase and program once with the help of a special tool called a programmer. A blank PROM chip allows current to run through all possible pathways; the programmer chooses a pathway for the current by sending a high voltage through the unwanted fuses to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; them out. Static electricity can create the same effect by accident, so PROMs are more vulnerable to damage than conventional ROMs.</p>
<p><strong>EPROM</strong>: Erasable Programmable ROM&nbsp;chips allow you to write and rewrite them many times. These chips feature a quartz window through which a specialized EPROM programmer emits a specific frequency of ultraviolet light. This light burns out all the tiny charges in the EPROM to reopen its circuits. This exposure effectively renders the chip blank again, after which you can reprogram it according to the same process as a PROM. EPROM chips will eventually wear out, but they frequently have lifetimes of over 1000 erasures.</p>
<p><strong>EEPROM</strong>: To modify an Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM&nbsp;chip, apply localized electrical fields to erase and rewrite the data. EEPROMs have several advantages over other types of ROM. Unlike the earlier forms, you can rewrite EEPROM without dedicated equipment, without removing it from the hardware, and in specifically designated increments. You don&rsquo;t have to erase and rewrite everything to make a single edit.</p>
<h2>Cache Memory</h2>
<p><strong>Cache memory</strong>&nbsp;is an extremely fast&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>&nbsp;type that acts as a buffer between&nbsp;<strong>RAM</strong>&nbsp;and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed.&nbsp;<strong>Cache memory</strong>&nbsp;is used to reduce the average time to access data from the Main&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>.</p>
<h2>Register</h2>
<p>A processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's processor. Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware functions, and may be read-only or write-only.</p>
