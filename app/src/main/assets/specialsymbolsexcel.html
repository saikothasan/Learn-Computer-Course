<h1 class="">Insert a symbol</h1>
<p>You can easily insert a special character, fraction, or other symbol in your PowerPoint presentations and Excel workbooks.</p>
<p>The most important thing to understand when inserting symbols, fractions, special characters, or international characters is that the font you use is critical. Not all fonts have the same characters in them. For example, the Elephant font has no fraction characters in it, while Verdana does. As a result it's important to use the right font to find the symbol or character you want.</p>
