<h1>ROM</h1>
<p><strong>ROM</strong>&nbsp;(read only memory) is a flash memory chip that contains a small amount of non-volatile memory. Non-volatile means that its contents cannot be changed and it retains its memory after the&nbsp;<strong>computer</strong>&nbsp;is turned off.</p>
<h2>History of ROM</h2>
<p>Read-only memory were employed as non-volatile storage for programs in most early stored-program computers, such as ENIAC after 1948. ... Most home computers of the 1980s stored a BASIC interpreter or operating system in&nbsp;<strong>ROM</strong>&nbsp;as other forms of non-volatile storage such as magnetic disk drives were too costly.</p>
<h2>Types of ROM</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p><strong>Programmable read-only memory</strong>&nbsp;(PROM), or&nbsp;<strong>one-time programmable ROM</strong>&nbsp;(OTP), can be written to or&nbsp;<strong>programmed</strong>&nbsp;via a special device called a&nbsp;<strong>PROM programmer</strong>. Typically, this device uses high voltages to permanently destroy or create internal links (fuses or antifuses) within the chip. Consequently, a PROM can only be programmed once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Erasable programmable read-only memory</strong>&nbsp;(EPROM) can be erased by exposure to strong ultravoilet&nbsp;light (typically for 10 minutes or longer), then rewritten with a process that again requires application of higher than usual voltage. Repeated exposure to UV light will eventually wear out an EPROM, but the <strong>endurance</strong>&nbsp;of most EPROM chips exceeds 1000 cycles of erasing and reprogramming. EPROM chip packages can often be identified by the prominent quartz&nbsp;"window" which allows UV light to enter. After programming, the window is typically covered with a label to prevent accidental erasure. Some EPROM chips are factory-erased before they are packaged, and include no window; these are effectively PROM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory</strong>&nbsp;(EEPROM) is based on a similar semiconductor structure to EPROM, but allows its entire contents (or selected&nbsp;<strong>banks</strong>) to be electrically erased, then rewritten electrically, so that they need not be removed from the computer (or camera, MP3 player, etc.). Writing or&nbsp;<strong>flashing</strong>&nbsp;an EEPROM is much slower (milliseconds per bit) than reading from a ROM or writing to a RAM (nanoseconds in both cases).</p>

<h2>Where is the ROM on a computer?</h2>
<p class="tab">For the computer, the main EEPROM and BIOS is on the computer motherboard.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">How does ROM work?</h2>
<p>ROM is sustained by a small, long-life battery in the computer. It contains two basic components: the decoder and the or logic gates. In ROM, the decoder receives input in binary&nbsp;form; the output will be the decimal equivalent. The OR gates in ROM use the decoder's decimal output as their input.</p>
<p>ROM performs like a disk array. It contains a grid of rows and columns that are used to turn the system on and off. Every element of the array correlates with a specific memory element on the ROM chip. A diode&nbsp;is used to connect the corresponding elements.</p>
<p>When a request is received, the address input is used to find the specific memory location. The value that is read from the ROM chip should match the contents of the chosen array element.</p>
