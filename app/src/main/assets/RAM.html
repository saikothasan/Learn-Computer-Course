<h1>RAM</h1>
<p>Alternatively referred to as&nbsp;main memory,&nbsp;primary memory, or&nbsp;system memory,&nbsp;RAM&nbsp;(random-access memory) is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer. RAM is usually associated with DRAM, which is a type of memory module. Because data is accessed randomly instead of sequentially like it is on a CD&nbsp;or hard drive, access times&nbsp;are much faster. However, unlike ROM, RAM is a volatile memory&nbsp;and requires power to keep the data accessible. If the computer is turned off, all data contained in RAM is lost.</p>
<h2 id="history">History of RAM</h2>
<p class="tab">The first form of RAM came about in 1947&nbsp;with the use of the Williams tube. It utilized a CRT&nbsp;(cathode ray tube); the data was stored on the face as electrically charged spots.</p>
<p class="tab">The second widely used form of RAM was magnetic-core memory, invented in 1947. Frederick Viehe is credited with much of the work, having filed for several patents relating to the design. Magnetic-core memory works through the use of tiny metal rings and wires connecting to each ring. One bit of data could be stored per ring and accessed at any time.</p>
<p class="tab">However, RAM, as we know it today, as solid state memory, was first invented in 1968&nbsp;by Robert Dennard. Known specifically as dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, transistors were used to store bits of data.</p>

<h2>Types of RAM</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>DRAM&nbsp;</strong>(pronounced DEE-RAM), is widely used as a computer&rsquo;s main memory. Each DRAM memory cell is made up of a transistor and a capacitor within an integrated circuit, and a data bit is stored in the capacitor. Since transistors always leak a small amount, the capacitors will slowly discharge, causing information stored in it to drain; hence, DRAM has to be refreshed (given a new electronic charge) every few milliseconds to retain data.</li>
<li><strong>SRAM&nbsp;</strong>(pronounced ES-RAM) is made up of four to six transistors. It keeps data in the memory as long as power is supplied to the system unlike DRAM, which has to be refreshed periodically. As such, SRAM is faster but also more expensive, making DRAM the more prevalent memory in computer systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the common types of DRAM?</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;synchronizes&rdquo; the memory speed with CPU clock speed so that the memory controller knows the exact clock cycle when the requested data will be ready. This allows the CPU to perform more instructions at a given time. Typical SDRAM transfers data at speeds up to 133 MHz.</li>
<li>&nbsp;<strong>Rambus DRAM (RDRAM)</strong>&nbsp;takes its name after the company that made it, Rambus. It was popular in the early 2000s and was mainly used for video game devices and graphics cards, with transfer speeds up to 1 GHz.</li>
<li><strong>Double Data Rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM)</strong>&nbsp;is a type of synchronous memory that nearly doubles the bandwidth of a single data rate (SDR) SDRAM running at the same clock frequency by employing a method&nbsp; called "double pumping," which allows transfer of data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal without any increase in clock frequency.</li>
