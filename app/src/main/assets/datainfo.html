<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Data is a raw and unorganized fact that required to be processed to make it meaningful. Data can be simple at the same time unorganized unless it is organized. Generally, data comprises facts, observations, perceptions numbers, characters, symbols, image, etc.</p>
<p>Data is always interpreted, by a human or machine, to derive meaning. So, data is meaningless. Data contains numbers, statements, and characters in a raw form.</p>
<h1>Information</h1>
<p>Information is a set of data which is processed in a meaningful way according to the given requirement. Information is processed, structured, or presented in a given context to make it meaningful and useful.</p>
<p>It is processed data which includes data that possess context, relevance, and purpose. It also involves manipulation of raw data.</p>
<p>Information assigns meaning and improves the reliability of the data. It helps to ensure undesirability and reduces uncertainty. So, when the data is transformed into information, it never has any useless details.</p>
<h2>Examples of Data and Information</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The history of temperature readings all over the world for the past 100 years is data. If this data is organized and analyzed to find that global temperature is rising, then that is information.</li>
<li>The number of visitors to a website by country is an example of data. Finding out that traffic from the U.S. is increasing while that from Australia is decreasing is meaningful information.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Integrity in the Data LifeCycle</h1>
<h2>1. Data Creation</h2>
<p>The first phase of the data lifecycle is the creation/capture of data. This data can be in many forms e.g. PDF, image, Word document, SQL database data.&nbsp; Data is typically created by an organisation in one of 3 ways:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Data Acquisition</strong>: acquiring already existing data which has been produced outside the organisation</li>
<li><strong>Data Entry</strong>: manual entry of new data by personnel within the organisation</li>
<li><strong>Data Capture</strong>: capture of data generated by devices used in various processes in the organisation</li>
<li>2. Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Once data has been created within the organisation, it needs to be stored and protected, with the appropriate level of security applied. A robust backup and recovery process should also be implemented to ensure retention of data during the lifecycle.</p>
<h2>3. Usage</h2>
<p>During the usage phase of the data lifecycle, data is used to support activities in the organisation. Data can be viewed, processed, modified and saved. An audit trail should be maintained for all critical data to ensure that all modifications to data are fully traceable. Data may also be made available to share with others outside the organisation.</p>
<h2>4. Archival</h2>
<p>Data Archival is the copying of data to an environment where it is stored in case it is needed again in an active production environment, and the removal of this data from all active production environments.</p>
<p>A data archive is simply a place where data is stored, but where no maintenance or general usage occurs.&nbsp; If necessary, the data can be restored to an environment where it can be used.</p>
<h2>5. Destruction</h2>
<p>The volume of archived data inevitably grows, and while you may want to save all your data forever, that&rsquo;s not feasible. Storage cost and compliance issues exert pressure to destroy data you no longer need. Data destruction or purging is the removal of every copy of a data item from an organisation. It is typically done from an archive storage location. The challenge of this phase of the lifecycle is to ensure that the data has been properly destroyed. It is important to ensure before destroying data that the data items have exceeded their required regulatory retention period.</p>
