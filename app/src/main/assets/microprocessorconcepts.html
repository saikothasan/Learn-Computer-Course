<h1>Microprocessor</h1>
<p>The microprocessor is the central unit of a computer system that performs arithmetic and logic operations, which generally include adding, subtracting, transferring numbers from one area to another, and comparing two numbers. It's often known simply as a processor, a central processing unit, or as a logic chip. It's essentially the engine or the brain of the computer that goes into motion when the computer is switched on. It's a programmable, multipurpose device that incorporates the functions of a CPU (central processing unit) on a single IC (integrated circuit).</p>
<h2>Working</h2>
<p>A microprocessor accepts binary data as input, processes that data, and then provides output based on the instructions stored in the memory. The data is processed using the microprocessor's ALU (arithmetical and logical unit), control unit, and a register array. The register array processes the data via a number of registers that act as temporary fast access memory locations. The flow of instructions and data through the system is managed by the control unit.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a Microprocessor</h2>
<p>But computer systems aren't the only devices that use microprocessors. Everything from smartphones to household appliances to cars use microprocessors these days. Here are a few reasons why microprocessors are so widely used:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>They don't cost a lot&nbsp;</strong>- Due to their use of IC technology, microprocessors don't cost much to produce. This means that the use of microprocessors can greatly reduce the cost of the system it's used in.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>They are fast</strong>&nbsp;- The technology used to produce modern microprocessors has allowed them to operate at incredibly high speeds--today's microprocessors can execute millions of instructions per second.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>They consume little power</strong>&nbsp;- Power consumption is much lower than other types of processors since microprocessors are manufactured using metal oxide semiconductor technology. This makes devices equipped with microprocessors much more energy efficient.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>They are portable&nbsp;</strong>- Due to how small microprocessors are and that they don't consume a lot of power, devices using microprocessors can be designed to be portable (like smartphones).<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>They are reliable</strong>&nbsp;- Because semiconductor technology is used in the production of microprocessors, their failure rate is extremely low.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>They are versatile&nbsp;</strong>- The same microprocessor chip can be used for numerous applications as long as the programming is changed, making it incredibly versatile.</li>

<h2>Categories of Microprocessors</h2>
<p>Microprocessors can be classified in different categories, as follows:.</p>
<h3>Based on Word Length</h3>
<p>Microprocessors can be based on the number of bits the processor's internal data bus or the number of bits that it can process at a time (which is known as the word length). Based on its word length, a microprocessor can be classified as 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)</h3>
<p>RISC microprocessors are more general use than those that have a more specific set of instructions. The execution of instructions in a processor requires a special circuit to load and process data. Because RISC microprocessors have fewer instructions, they have simpler circuits, which means they operate faster. Additionally, RISC microprocessors have more registers, use more RAM, and use a fixed number of clock cycles to execute one instruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Complex Instruction Set Computer</h3>
<p>CISC microprocessors are the opposite of RISC microprocessors. Their purpose is to reduce the number of instructions for each program. The number of cycles per instruction is ignored. Because complex instructions are made directly into the hardware, CISC microprocessors are more complex and slower. CISC microprocessors use little RAM, have more transistors, have fewer registers, have numerous clock cycles for each instruction, and have a variety of addressing modes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Special Purpose Processors</h3>
<p>Some microprocessors are built to perform specific functions. For example, coprocessors are used in combination with a main processor, while a transputer is a transistor computer: a microprocessor that has its own local memory.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Evolution of Microprocessors</h2>
<p>We can categorize the microprocessor according to the generations or according to the size of the microprocessor:</p>
<h3 class="h3">First Generation (4 - bit Microprocessors)</h3>
<p>The first generation microprocessors were introduced in the year 1971-1972 by Intel Corporation. It was named&nbsp;<strong>Intel 4004</strong>&nbsp;since it was a 4-bit processor.</p>
<p>It was a processor on a single chip. It could perform simple arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, Boolean OR and Boolean AND.</p>
<p>I had a control unit capable of performing control functions like fetching an instruction from storage memory, decoding it, and then generating control pulses to execute it.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Second Generation (8 - bit Microprocessor)</h3>
<p>The second generation microprocessors were introduced in 1973 again by Intel. It was a first 8 - bit microprocessor which could perform arithmetic and logic operations on 8-bit words. It was Intel 8008, and another improved version was Intel 8088.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Third Generation (16 - bit Microprocessor)</h3>
<p>The third generation microprocessors, introduced in 1978 were represented by&nbsp;<strong>Intel's 8086, Zilog Z800 and 80286</strong>, which were 16 - bit processors with a performance like minicomputers.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Fourth Generation (32 - bit Microprocessors)</h3>
<p>Several different companies introduced the 32-bit microprocessors, but the most popular one is the&nbsp;<strong>Intel 80386</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Fifth Generation (64 - bit Microprocessors)</h3>
<p>From 1995 to now we are in the fifth generation. After 80856, Intel came out with a new processor namely Pentium processor followed by&nbsp;<strong>Pentium Pro CPU</strong>, which allows multiple CPUs in a single system to achieve multiprocessing.</p>
<p>Other improved 64-bit processors are&nbsp;<strong>Celeron, Dual, Quad, Octa Core processors</strong>.</p>
