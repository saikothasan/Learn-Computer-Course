<h1>Formatting</h1>
<p>One of the most powerful tools in Microsoft Office is the application of formatting feature. This feature basically lets you define the right format once and apply the same to a series of objects in the rest of the presentation or any other file. While working with large presentations or just working on slides for a long time, if you ever need to make a change in the style and want it applied across multiple content this is the tool to use.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Go to the&nbsp;<strong>Clipboard</strong>&nbsp;group under the&nbsp;<strong>Home</strong>&nbsp;ribbon.</p>
