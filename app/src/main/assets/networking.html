<h1>Network</h1>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>network</strong>&nbsp;consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a&nbsp;<strong>network</strong>&nbsp;may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.</p>
<h2>Computer networking</h2>
<p>A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes.</p>
<h2><strong>Characteristics of Computer Network</strong></h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Sharing Resources&nbsp;</strong>from one Computer to another Computer over a network</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Performance&nbsp;</strong>by measuring the speed of data transmission with number of users, connectivity and the software used</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Reliability&nbsp;</strong>makes easy to use an alternative source for data communication in case of hardware failure or connectivity issues</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Scalability&nbsp;</strong>increases the system performance by adding more processors</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Security&nbsp;</strong>is the main characteristics of Computer network where you can take necessary steps for protecting your data from unauthorized access</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Network</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Local Area Networks (LAN)</strong><br />A local area network or LAN&nbsp;is a network that connects computers within a limited area. This might be in a school, an office or even a home.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Area Networks (PAN)</strong>&zwj;<br />A personal area network is a network that is based on an individual's workspace. The individual's device is the center of the network, with other devices connected to it. There are also wireless personal area networks.</li>
<li><strong>Home Area Networks (HAN)<br />&zwj;</strong>A home area network connects devices within a home environment. It might include personal computers, tablets, smartphones, printers, TVs and other devices.</li>
<li><strong>Wide Area Networks (WAN)<br />&zwj;</strong>A wide area network&nbsp;is a network that covers a larger geographical area, usually with a radius of more than a kilometer.</li>
<li><strong>Campus Networks<br />&zwj;</strong>A campus network is a LAN&nbsp;or set of connected LANs which is used by a government agency, university, corporation or similar organization and is typically a network across a set of buildings that are close together.</li>
<li><strong>Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)<br />&zwj;</strong>Metropolitan area networks are networks that stretch across a region the size of a metropolitan area. A MAN is a series of connected LANs in a city, which might also connect to a WAN.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Private Networks<br />&zwj;</strong>An enterprise private network is used by a company to connect its various sites so that the different locations can share resources.</li>
<li><strong>Internetworks<br />&zwj;</strong>Internetworks connect different networks together to build a larger network. Internetworking is often used to describe building a large, global network.</li>
<li><strong>Backbone Networks (BBN)<br />&zwj;</strong>A backbone is a part of a network that connects different pieces and provides a path for information to be exchanged.</li>
<li><strong>Global Area Networks (GAN)<br />&zwj;</strong>A global area network is a worldwide network that connects networks all over the globe, such as the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Networking Terms</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Open system:</strong>&nbsp;an open system is connected to the network and prepared for communication.</li>
<li><strong>Closed system:</strong>&nbsp;a closed system is not connected to the network and so can't be communicated with.</li>
<li>&zwj;<strong>IP (internet protocol) address:</strong>&nbsp;the network address of the system across the network, which is also known as the Logical Address).</li>
<li><strong>MAC address:</strong>&nbsp;the MAC address or physical address uniquely identifies each host. It is associated with the Network Interface Card (NIC).</li>
<li><strong>Port:</strong>&nbsp;a port is a channel through which data is sent and received.</li>
<li><strong>Nodes:</strong>&nbsp;nodes is a term used to refer to any computing devices such as computers that send and receive network packets across the network.</li>
<li><strong>Network packets:</strong>&nbsp;the data that is sent to and from the nodes in a network.</li>
<li><strong>Routers:</strong>&nbsp;routers are pieces of hardware that manage router packets. They determine which node the information came from and where to send it to. A router has a routing protocol which defines how it communicates with other routers.</li>
<li>&zwj;<strong>Network address translation (NAT):</strong>&nbsp;a technique that routers use to provide internet service to more devices using fewer public IPs. A router has a public IP address but devices connected to it are assigned private IPs that others outside of the network can't see.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP):</strong>&nbsp;assigns dynamic IP addresses to hosts and is maintained by the internet service provider.</li>
<li><strong>Internet service providers (ISP):</strong>&nbsp;companies that provide everyone with their internet connection, both to individuals and to businesses and other organizations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Network Cables</h2>
<p>Network cables are used to connect computers. The most commonly used cable is Category 5 cable RJ-45.</p>
<h2>Distributors</h2>
<p>A computer can be connected to another one via a serial port but if we need to connect many computers to produce a network, this serial connection will not work.</p>
<p>The solution is to use a central body to which other computers, printers, scanners, etc. can be connected and then this body will manage or distribute network traffic.</p>
<h2>Router</h2>
<p>A router is a type of device which acts as the central point among computers and other devices that are a part of the network. It is equipped with holes called ports. Computers and other devices are connected to a router using network cables. Now-a-days router comes in wireless modes using which computers can be connected without any physical cable.</p>
<h2>Network Card</h2>
<p>Network card is a necessary component of a computer without which a computer cannot be connected over a network. It is also known as the network adapter or Network Interface Card (NIC). Most branded computers have network card pre-installed. Network cards are of two types: Internal and External Network Cards.</p>
<h3>Internal Network Cards</h3>
<p>Motherboard has a slot for internal network card where it is to be inserted. Internal network cards are of two types in which the first type uses Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) connection, while the second type uses Industry Standard Architecture (ISA). Network cables are required to provide network access.</p>
<h3>External Network Cards</h3>
<p>External network cards are of two types: Wireless and USB based. Wireless network card needs to be inserted into the motherboard, however no network cable is required to connect to the network.</p>
<h2>Universal Serial Bus (USB)</h2>
<p>USB card is easy to use and connects via USB port. Computers automatically detect USB card and can install the drivers required to support the USB network card automatically.</p>
