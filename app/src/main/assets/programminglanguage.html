<h1>Programming language</h1>
<p>Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a &ldquo;binary.&rdquo; Translating programming language into binary is known as &ldquo;compiling.&rdquo; Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.</p>
<p>These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Machine and assembly languages</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">A machine language consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly. The codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or binary&nbsp;digits (&ldquo;bits&rdquo;), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16) for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations, such as addition, and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine language is difficult to read and write, since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human language, and its codes vary from computer to computer.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Assembly language is designed to be easily translated into machine language. Although blocks of data may be referred to by name instead of by their machine addresses, assembly language does not provide more sophisticated means of organizing complex information. Like machine language, assembly language requires detailed knowledge of internal computer architecture. It is useful when such details are important, as in programming a computer to interact with peripheral devices&nbsp;(printers, scanners, storage devices, and so forth).</p>

<h2 class="h2">Algorithmic languages</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Algorithmic languages are designed to express mathematical or symbolic computations. They can express algebraic operations in notation similar to mathematics and allow the use of subprograms that package commonly used operations for reuse. They were the first high-level languages.</p>
<span id="ref248108" data-level="2"></span>
<h2 class="md-sentinel--spy-target">FORTRAN</h2>
<section id="ref248109" data-level="3" data-has-spy="true">
<p class="topic-paragraph">The first important algorithmic language was FORTRAN(<em>for</em>mula&nbsp;<em>tran</em>slation), designed in 1957 by an IBM&nbsp;team led by John Backus. It was intended for scientific computations with real numbers&nbsp;and collections of them organized as one- or multidimensional arrays. Its control structures included conditional IF statements, repetitive loops (so-called DO loops), and a GOTO statement that allowed nonsequential execution of program code. FORTRAN made it convenient to have subprograms for common mathematical operations, and built libraries of them.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">FORTRAN was also designed to translate into efficient machine language. It was immediately successful and continues to evolve.</p>

<h2 class="md-sentinel--spy-target">&nbsp;ALGOL</h2>
<section id="ref248110" data-level="3" data-has-spy="true">
<p class="topic-paragraph">ALGOL (<em>algo</em>rithmic&nbsp;<em>l</em>anguage) was designed by a committee of American and European computer scientists during 1958&ndash;60 for publishing algorithms, as well as for doing computations. Like LISP (described in the next section), ALGOL had recursive subprograms&mdash;procedures that could invoke&nbsp;themselves to solve a problem by reducing it to a smaller problem of the same kind. ALGOL introduced&nbsp;<span id="ref849808"></span>block structure, in which a program is composed of blocks that might contain both data and instructions and have the same structure as an entire program. Block structure became a powerful tool for building large programs out of small components.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">ALGOL contributed a notation for describing the structure of a programming language, Backus&ndash;Naur Form, which in some variation became the standard tool for stating the syntax(grammar) of programming languages. ALGOL was widely used in Europe, and for many years it remained the language in which computer algorithms were published. Many important languages, such as Pascal&nbsp;and Ada (both described later), are its descendants.</p>

<h2 class="h3">LISP</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">LISP(<em>lis</em>t&nbsp;<em>p</em>rocessing) was developed about 1960 by John McCarthy&nbsp;at the Massachusetts Institute of technology&nbsp;(MIT) and was founded on the mathematical theory of recursive functions (in which a function appears in its own definition). A LISP program is a function applied to data, rather than being a sequence of procedural steps as in FORTRAN and ALGOL. LISP uses a very simple notation in which operations and their operands are given in a parenthesized list. For example, (+&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;(*&nbsp;<em>b</em>&nbsp;<em>c</em>)) stands for&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>b</em>*<em>c</em>. Although this appears awkward, the notation works well for computers. LISP also uses the list structure to represent data, and, because programs and data use the same structure, it is easy for a LISP program to operate on other programs as data.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">LISP became a common language for artificial Intelligence&nbsp;(AI) programming, partly owing to the confluence&nbsp;of LISP and AI work at MIT and partly because AI programs capable of &ldquo;learning&rdquo; could be written in LISP as self-modifying programs. LISP has evolved through numerous dialects, such as Scheme and Common LISP.</p>

<h2 class="md-sentinel--spy-target">C</h2>
<section id="ref248112" data-level="3" data-has-spy="true">
<p class="topic-paragraph">The C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Richtie&nbsp;and Brian Kernighan at the AT&amp;T Corporation&nbsp;for programming computer operating systems. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition&nbsp;of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming, and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computer&rsquo;s internal architecture. C, along with its descendant C++, remains one of the most common languages.</p>

<p class="topic-paragraph">COBOL (<em>co</em>mmon&nbsp;<em>b</em>usiness&nbsp;<em>o</em>riented&nbsp;<em>l</em>anguage) has been heavily used by businesses since its inception in 1959. A committee of computer manufacturers and users and U.S. government organizations established CODASYL (<em>Co</em>mmittee on&nbsp;<em>Da</em>ta&nbsp;<em>Sy</em>stems and&nbsp;<em>L</em>anguages) to develop and oversee the language standard in order to ensure its portability across diverse&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">COBOL uses an English-like notation&mdash;novel when introduced. Business computations organize and manipulate large quantities of data, and COBOL introduced the record data structures&nbsp;for such tasks. A record clusters heterogenous data&mdash;such as a name, an ID number, an age, and an address&mdash;into a single unit. This contrasts with scientific languages, in which homogenous&nbsp;arrays of numbers are common. Records are an important example of &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; data into a single object, and they appear in nearly all modern languages.</p>

<p class="topic-paragraph">SQL (structured query language) is a language for specifying the organization of databases&nbsp;(collections of records). Databases organized with SQL are called relational, because SQL provides the ability to query a database for information that falls in a given relation. For example, a query might be &ldquo;find all records with both last name&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith and city New York.&rdquo; Commercial database programs commonly use an SQL-like language for their queries.</p>

<h2 class="h3">BASIC</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">BASIC (beginner&rsquo;s all-purpose symbolic instruction code) was designed at Dartmouth College&nbsp;in the mid-1960s by John Kemeny&nbsp;and Thomas Kurtz. It was intended to be easy to learn by novices, particularly non-computer science majors, and to run well on a time-sharing computer with many users. It had simple data structures&nbsp;and notation and it was interpreted: a BASIC program was translated line-by-line and executed as it was translated, which made it easy to locate programming errors.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Its small size and simplicity also made BASIC a popular language for early personal computers. Its recent forms have adopted many of the data and control structures of other contemporary languages, which makes it more powerful but less convenient for beginners.</p>

<h2 class="h3"><span id="ref134618"></span>PASCAL</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">About 1970 Niklaus Wirth&nbsp;of Switzerland&nbsp;designed Pascal&nbsp;to teach structured programming, which emphasized the orderly use of conditional and loop control structures without GOTO statements. Although Pascal resembled ALGOL&nbsp;in notation, it provided the ability to define data types with which to organize complex information, a feature beyond the capabilities of ALGOL as well as FORTRAN and COBOL. User-defined data types allowed the programmer to introduce names for complex data, which the language translator could then check for correct usage before running a program.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">During the late 1970s and &rsquo;80s, Pascal was one of the most widely used languages for programming instruction. It was available on nearly all computers, and, because of its familiarity, clarity, and security, it was used for production software&nbsp;as well as for education.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="h3">HyperTalk</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">HyperTalk was designed as &ldquo;programming for the rest of us&rdquo; by Bill Atkinson for Apple&rsquo;s Macintosh. Using a simple English-like syntax, Hypertalk enabled anyone to combine text, graphics, and audio quickly into &ldquo;linked stacks&rdquo; that could be navigated by clicking with a mouse&nbsp;on standard buttons supplied by the program. Hypertalk was particularly popular among educators in the 1980s and early &rsquo;90s for classroom multimedia presentations. Although Hypertalk had many features of object-oriented languages (described in the next section), Apple did not develop it for other computer platforms and let it languish; as Apple&rsquo;s market share declined in the 1990s, a new cross-platform way of displaying multimedia left Hypertalk all but obsolete (<em>see</em>&nbsp;the section World Wide Web Display Languages ).</p>

<h2 class="md-sentinel--spy-target">Object Oriented languages</h2>
<section id="ref248121" data-level="2" data-has-spy="true">
<p class="topic-paragraph">Object-oriented languages help to manage complexity in large programs. Objects package data and the operations on them so that only the operations are publicly accessible and internal details of the data structures are hidden. This information hiding made large-scale programming easier by allowing a programmer to think about each part of the program in isolation. In addition, objects may be derived from more general ones, &ldquo;inheriting&rdquo; their capabilities. Such an object hierarchy&nbsp;made it possible to define specialized objects without repeating all that is in the more general ones.</p>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Object-oriented programming began with the Simula language (1967), which added information hiding to ALGOL. Another influential object-oriented language was Smalltalk (1980), in which a program was a set of objects that interacted by sending messages to one another.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="h3">C++</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">The C++ language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&amp;T in the mid-1980s, extended&nbsp;<a class="md-crosslink autoxref" href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/C-computer-programming-language">C</a>&nbsp;by adding objects to it while preserving the efficiency&nbsp;of C programs. It has been one of the most important languages for both education and industrial programming. Large parts of many operating systems were written in C++. C++, along with Java, has become popular for developing commercial software packages that incorporate multiple interrelated applications. C++ is considered one of the fastest languages and is very close to low-level languages, thus allowing complete control over memory allocation and management. This very feature and its many other capabilities also make it one of the most difficult languages to learn and handle on a large scale.</p>

<p class="topic-paragraph">In the early 1990s, Java&nbsp;was designed by Sun Microsystem,Inc<a class="md-crosslink" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sun-Microsystems-Inc">.</a>, as a programming language for the World Wide Web&nbsp;(WWW). Although it resembled C++ in appearance, it was fully object-oriented. In particular, Java dispensed with lower-level features, including the ability to manipulate data addresses, a capability that is neither desirable nor useful in programs for distributed systems. In order to be portable, Java programs are translated by a Java Virtual Machine specific to each computer platform, which then executes the Java program. In addition to adding interactive capabilities to the internet&nbsp;through Web &ldquo;applets,&rdquo; Java has been widely used for programming small and portable devices, such as mobile telephones.</p>
