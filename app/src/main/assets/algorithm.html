<h2 data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Definition-</strong></h2>
<p>In programming, algorithm is a set of well defined instructions in sequence to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>Qualities of a good algorithm</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Input&nbsp;and output&nbsp;should be defined precisely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each steps in algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Algorithm should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An algorithm shouldn&rsquo;t have computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that, it&nbsp;can be used in similar programming languages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Examples Of Algorithms In Programming</h2>
<p><strong>Write an algorithm to add two numbers entered by user.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Start&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Read values num1 and num2.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum. sum&larr;num1+num2&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Display sum&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Stop</p>
<p><strong>Write an algorithm to find the largest among three different numbers entered by user.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Start&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Declare variables a,b and c.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Read variables a,b and c.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If a&gt;b If a&gt;c Display a is the largest number. Else Display c is the largest number. Else If b&gt;c Display b is the largest number. Else Display c is the greatest number.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Stop</p>
<h2>Advantages of algorithm</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p>It is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem, which makes it easy to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An algorithm uses a&nbsp;definite procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not dependent on any programming language, so it is easy to understand for anyone even without programming knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every step&nbsp;in an algorithm has its own logical sequence so it is easy to debug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using algorithm, the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps hence, it is easier for programmer to convert it into an actual program</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages of algorithm</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p>Writing algorithm takes a&nbsp;long time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An&nbsp;Algorithm is not a computer program, it is rather a concept of how a&nbsp;program should be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Flowchart </strong></h1>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>flowchart</strong>&nbsp;is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process. The&nbsp;<strong>flowchart</strong>&nbsp;shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. &hellip;&nbsp;<strong>Flowcharts</strong>&nbsp;are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.</p>
<h2>Flowchart Symbols</h2>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Flowcharts use special shapes to represent different types of actions or steps in a process.Lines and arrows show the sequence of the steps, and the relationships among them. These are known as flowchart symbols.</p>
<h2>Common Flowchart Symbols</h2>
<ul class="vertList" style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p><strong>Rectangle Shape</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Represents a process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oval or Pill Shape</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Represents the start or end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diamond Shape</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Represents a decision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parallelogram</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Represents input/output</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages of flowchart:</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p>The Flowchart is an excellent way of communicating the logic of a program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is easy and efficient to analyze problem using flowchart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During program development cycle, the flowchart plays the role of a guide or a blueprint. Which makes program development process&nbsp;easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After successful development of a program, it needs continuous timely maintenance during the course of its operation. The flowchart makes program or system maintenance easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It helps the programmer to write the program code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is easy to convert the flowchart into any programming language code as it does not use any specific programming language concept.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantage of flowchart:</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p>The flowchart can be complex when the logic of a&nbsp;program is quite complicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drawing flowchart is a time-consuming task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficult to alter the flowchart. Sometimes, the designer needs to redraw the complete flowchart to change the logic of the flowchart or to alter the flowchart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since it uses special sets of symbols for every action, it is quite a tedious task to develop a flowchart as it requires special tools to draw the necessary symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a&nbsp;complex&nbsp;flowchart, other programmers might have a&nbsp;difficult time understanding the logic and process of the flowchart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is just a visualization of a program, it cannot function like an actual program</p>
</li>
</ul>
