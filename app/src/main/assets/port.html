<h1>Ports</h1>
<p>A Computerr Port is an interface or a point of connection between the computer and its peripheral devices. Some of the common peripherals are mouse, keyboard, monitor or display unit, printer, speaker, flash drive etc.</p>
<p>The main function of a computer port is to act as a point of attachment, where the cable from the peripheral can be plugged in and allows data to flow from and to the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A computer port is also called as a Communication Port as it is responsible for communication between the computer and its peripheral device. Generally, the female end of the connector is referred to as a port and it usually sits on the motherboard.</p>
<p>In Computers, communication ports can be divided into two types based on the type or protocol used for communication. They are Serial Ports and Parallel Ports that are as follows.</p>
<h2>PS/2</h2>
<p>PS/2 connector is developed by IBM for connecting mouse and keyboard. It was introduced with IBM&rsquo;s Personal Systems/2 series of computers and hence the name PS/2 connector. PS/2 connectors are color coded as purple for keyboard and green for mouse.</p>
<h2>Serial Port</h2>
<p>Even though the communication in PS/2 and USB is serial, technically, the term Serial Port is used to refer the interface that is compliant to RS-232 standard. There are two types of serial ports that are commonly found on a computer: DB-25 and DE-9.</p>
<h2>DB-25</h2>
<p>DB-25 is a variant of D-sub connector and is the original port for RS-232 serial communication. They were developed as the main port for serial connections using RS-232 protocol but most of the applications did not require all the pins.</p>
<p>Hence, DE-9 was developed for RS-232 based serial communication while DB-25 was rarely used as a serial port and often used as a parallel printer port as a replacement of the Centronics Parallel 36 pin connector.</p>
<h2>DE-9 or RS-232 or COM Port</h2>
<p>DE-9 is the main port for RS-232 serial communication. It is a D-sub connector with E shell and is often miscalled as DB-9. A DE-9 port is also called as a COM port and allows full duplex serial communication between the computer and it&rsquo;s peripheral.</p>
<p>Some of the applications of DE-9 port are serial interface with mouse, keyboard, modem, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and other external RS-232 compatible devices.</p>
<h2>Parallel Port or Centronics 36 Pin Port</h2>
<p>Parallel port is an interface between computer and peripheral devices like printers with parallel communication. The Centronics port is a 36 pin port that was developed as an interface for printers and scanners and hence a parallel port is also called as a Centronics port.</p>
<p>Before the wide use of USB ports, parallel ports are very common in printers. The Centronics port was later replaced by DB-25 port with parallel interface.</p>
<h2>Audio Ports</h2>
<p>Audio ports are used to connect speakers or other audio output devices with the computer. The audio signals can be either analogue or digital and depending on that the port and its corresponding connector differ.</p>
<h2>Video Ports</h2>
<h3>VGA Port</h3>
<p>VGA port is found in many computers, projectors, video cards and High Definition TVs. It is a D-sub connector consisting of 15 pins in 3 rows. The connector is called as DE-15.</p>
<p>VGA port is the main interface between computers and older CRT monitors. Even the modern LCD and LED monitors support VGA ports but the picture quality is reduced. VGA carries analogue video signals up to a resolution of 648X480.</p>
<h3>Digital Video Interface (DVI)</h3>
<p>DVI is a high speed digital interface between a display controller like a computer and a display device like a monitor. It was developed with an aim of transmitting lossless digital video signals and replace the analogue VGA technology.</p>
<p>There are three types of DVI connectors based on the signals it can carry: DVI-I, DVI-D and DVI-A. DVI-I is a DVI port with integrated analogue and digital signals. DVI-D supports only digital signals and DVI-A supports only analogue signals.</p>
<p>The digital signals can be either single link or dual link where a single link supports a digital signal up to 1920X1080 resolution and a dual link supports a digital signal up to 2560X1600 resolution. The following image compares the structures of DVI-I, DVI-D and DVI-A types along with the pinouts.</p>
<h3>Mini-DVI</h3>
<p>Mini-DVI port is developed by Apple as an alternative to Mini-VGA port and is physically similar to one. It is smaller than a regular DVI port.</p>
<p>It is a 32 pin port and is capable of transmitting DVI, composite, S-Video and VGA signals with respective adapters. The following image shows a Mini-DVI port and its compatible cable.</p>
<h3>Micro-DVI</h3>
<p>Micro-DVI port, as the name suggests is physically smaller than Mini-DVI and is capable of transmitting only digital signals.</p>
<p>This port can be connected to external devices with DVI and VGA interfaces and respective adapters are required. In the following image, a Micro-DVI port can be seen adjacent to headphone and USB ports.</p>
<h3>Display Port</h3>
<p>Display Port is a digital display interface with optional multiple channel audio and other forms of data. Display Port is developed with an aim of replacing VGA and DVI ports as the main interface between a computer and monitor.</p>
<p>The latest version DisplayPort 1.3 can handle a resolution up to 7680 X 4320.</p>
