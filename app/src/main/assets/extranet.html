<h1>Extranet</h1>
<p>An extranet&nbsp;is a controlled, private network that uses the internet for secure collaboration and information sharing among internal team members, as well as a company&rsquo;s external contacts, such as customers, suppliers, partners, and other third parties. You can think of it like an extended intranet, as sometimes external parties access parts of the company&rsquo;s intranet network through different authentication means, such as user IDs and passwords.</p>
<p>Put simply, though,&nbsp;<strong>an extranet is a solution that enables you to collaborate and communicate with clients, vendors, and other third parties.</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of extranets is to enable the distribution and access of information to many people in a more efficient way than email.&nbsp;By creating a secure, online, centralized environment, invited members can easily store, share, and access the information they need anytime.</p>
<p>There are numerous examples of extranet applications, including customer portal, distributor or partner portals, collaborative project workspaces, team workspaces, and so on. We explore a few of these, along with extranet advantages, below.</p>
<h2>Advantages Of Extranets In Business</h2>
<h3>1. Information sharing is simple.</h3>
<p>Without a client extranet, you&rsquo;re likely sharing files with outside parties via email. This leads to outdated document versions, large file attachments clogging up inboxes, and important information being lost or overlooked. It can also be time consuming and irritating to search for information buried deep in email threads.</p>
<p>An extranet ensures all relevant information&mdash;including all versions of uploaded documents&mdash;is in one place. Add to that the indexability of a modern solution, and everyone finds what they need in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>Break the email chain with Glasscubes, an extranet solution focused on ensuring everyone that needs to stay in the know&nbsp;actually&nbsp;does. Making information sharing simple is what Glasscubes does best, whether your organisation is a law firm,public sector agency, or charity.</p>
<p>Do you need to ask your client a quick question or make an announcement? There&rsquo;s no need to craft an entire email to get or share information. In Glasscubes, you can use threaded discussions to have conversations in context. You can also make an announcement for the entire workspace so both your team and the client team are on the same page.</p>
<p>For example, you may be going on vacation for a week and want to ensure everyone knows exactly when you&rsquo;ll be unavailable and who they should contact in the meantime. You can make a workspace announcement a week in advance, and leave it up until you return. When people log in, they&rsquo;re made aware of your absence, so they can avoid emailing you and receiving a surprising out-of-office message.</p>
<h3>2. Documents are safe and secure.</h3>
<p>Information is the lifeblood of any organisation. With an extranet, your important documents will be up to date and stored securely, typically with SSL encryption. A robust extranet can provide access control, enabling you to limit access to certain areas and files. It can even provide an audit trail, letting you see which users have accessed files and when.</p>
<p>In Glasscubes, all your files are stored securely with built-in SSL encryption. In fact, all data is encrypted in transit and while at rest. Additionally, your documents are automatically version-controlled as soon as you upload them. No need to worry whether you&rsquo;re working on the latest document. As long as you&rsquo;re accessing the document from Glasscubes, you know it&rsquo;s the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a combo feature in Glasscubes that not every extranet has: read and approval workflows. Want confirmation that a new employee read your corporate policies? Use a&nbsp;read request. Need your manager to sign off on a design before it goes to the client? Use an&nbsp;approval request.</p>
<h3>3. Project management is easy.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple for internal staff and third parties to collaborate within a modern extranet, including remote workers. Users can access the information and tools they need from any smartphone or mobile device, and work on common documents at their convenience.</p>
<p>By taking advantage of the many collaboration tools within an extranet, you can avoid having endless meetings, making phone calls, or sending emails to keep all stakeholders up to date.&nbsp;You can upload, store, and edit documents; assign and manage tasks, organise calendars and conference calls; make announcements; start and contribute to discussions; and quickly gather group feedback.</p>

<p>Project management is another area where Glasscubes excels. It makes delivering both small and large projects an easier task. And speaking of tasks&mdash;whether you have 10 or 100, you can quickly assign them to the right team members (or client personnel) to ensure everyone knows who&rsquo;s responsible for what. Expect status meetings to be more organized and less time-consuming.</p>
<p>Glasscubes also has useful planning features such as task dependencies and critical path analyses. You can even visualise your project schedule with a Gantt chart. With all these valuable project management features, you&rsquo;re bound to deliver on time and within budget.</p>
<h3>4. Setup and training require little to no IT involvement.</h3>
<p>While traditional extranet solutions were a pain to set up and maintain, modern versions don&rsquo;t need IT assistance, specialized hardware, or technical knowledge. These extranets are typically cloud-based, meaning they practically maintain themselves. In addition, most are fairly intuitive, enabling users to quickly grasp how to get things done. The results are an easier-to-use platform and lower costs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it&mdash;unless you&rsquo;re a huge corporation, you probably don&rsquo;t have an entire IT department at your disposal. At best, you keep an IT consultant on speed dial or have an employee who happens to know their way around a computer. You don&rsquo;t have the budget or in-house resources to set up, let alone maintain, a complex collaboration solution.</p>
<p>With a simple, user-friendly solution like Glasscubes, there&rsquo;s no need for any technical know-how or advanced software knowledge. Once you log in, the intuitive interface will have you feeling like you&rsquo;ve used the solution for years after only a few hours.</p>
<h3>5. Professional branding makes a great impression.</h3>
<p>Modern Extranets can be customised to your requirements, helping you project a positive, professional image to clients. Not only can you create a secure, online environment, but it can also be branded to appear as your organisation&rsquo;s own collaboration solution.</p>
<p>Making a positive impression on clients is an important part of establishing a long-term relationship. You want every interaction with your clients to further cement your brand as their go-to choice for provider, regardless of the products and services you offer. Glasscubes is a white-label solution you can modify to suit your needs&mdash;you can use your brand colors, logo, and more. Ensure your clients have a seamless brand experience, even while they&rsquo;re performing simple tasks like sharing files and responding to threaded discussions.</p>
