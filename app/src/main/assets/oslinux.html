<h1>Linux</h1>
<p><strong>LINUX</strong>&nbsp;is an operating system or a kernel distributed under an open-source license. Its functionality list is quite like UNIX. The kernel is a program at the heart of the Linux operating system that takes care of fundamental stuff, like letting hardware communicate with software.</p>
<h2>Why do you need an OS?</h2>
<p>Every time you switch on your computer, you see a screen where you can perform different activities like write, browse the internet or watch a video. What is it that makes the computer hardware work like that? How does the processor on your computer know that you are asking it to run a mp3 file?</p>
<p>Well, it is the operating system or the kernel which does this work. So, to work on your computer, you need an Operating System(OS). In fact, you are using one as you read this on your computer. Now, you may have used popular OS's like Windows, Apple OS X, but here we will learn introduction to Linux operating system, Linux overview and what benefits it offers over other OS choices.</p>
<h2>Who created Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux is an operating system or a kernel which germinated as an idea in the mind of young and bright&nbsp;<strong>Linus Torvalds</strong>&nbsp;when he was a computer science student. He used to work on the&nbsp;<strong>UNIX OS (proprietary software)&nbsp;</strong>and thought that it needed improvements.</p>
<p>However, when his suggestions were rejected by the designers of UNIX, he thought of launching an OS which will be&nbsp;<strong>receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users</strong>.</p>
<h2>The benefits of using Linux</h2>
<p>Linux OS now enjoys popularity at its prime, and it's famous among programmers as well as regular computer users around the world. Its main benefits are -</p>
<p>It offers a&nbsp;<strong>free operating system</strong>. You do not have to shell hundreds of dollars to get the OS like Windows!</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p>Being open-source, anyone with programming knowledge can modify it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is easy to learn Linux for beginners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Linux operating systems now offer&nbsp;<strong>millions of programs/applications and Linux softwares to choose from</strong>, most of them are free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have Linux installed you no longer need an antivirus! Linux is a highly secure system. More so, there is a global development community constantly looking at ways to enhance its security. With each upgrade, the OS becomes more secure and robust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux freeware is the OS of choice for Server environments due to its stability and reliability (Mega-companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google use Linux for their Servers). A Linux based server could run non-stop without a reboot for years on end.</p>
