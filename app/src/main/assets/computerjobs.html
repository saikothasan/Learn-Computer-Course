Typical duties include reviewing, implementing, updating and documenting information security policies and procedures within an organization, in addition to ensuring that legal and contractual security and privacy mandates are adhered to.</p>
<h2>9. Health information technology careers</h2>
<p>While jobs in technology continue to rise in prevalence, so too do jobs in the healthcare field.Health Information technology&nbsp;(HIT) is an excellent way to blend the two, launching your career in the midst of rapid growth. The HIT field is a specialized subset of information technology professionals who work for medical facilities and other healthcare organizations to increase the efficiency and quality of clinical care through technology. You can expect to encounter tech positions in healthcare environments that center on elements like electronic billing and coding systems, electronic medical records and networks for digital imaging.</p>
<h2>10. Statistician</h2>
<p>Quality statisticians are needed in a litany of different industries, including economics, government, business, biology, engineering, politics, public health, medicine, psychology, marketing, education and even sports. They collect, analyze and present data using their knowledge of statistics to conduct surveys, opinion polls and more. Statisticians use their technical skills to determine how to best collect information, what groups to test, what questions to ask and how to interpret and publish their findings.</p>
<h2>11. Mathematician</h2>
<p>Mathematicians use mathematical theory, algorithms and computational methods to answer questions relating to everything from economics, business and engineering to physics and other sciences. They are often tasked with both utilizing existing mathematical theories and developing new ones to connect previously unknown relationships between mathematical concepts. Our digital landscape&rsquo;s influx of technical capabilities has catapulted mathematicians&rsquo; abilities to develop data-driven solutions for real-world problems.</p>
<h2>12. Business intelligence analyst</h2>
<p>Business intelligence analyst are responsible for designing and developing data analysis and reporting solutions, communicating analysis results while making recommendations to senior management teams and developing data cleansing regulations for their organizations. In order to land this computer career, you&rsquo;ll need to have a strong background in database technology, analytical reporting and languages like SQL and Python, while also demonstrating excellent written and oral communication skills.</p>
<h2>13. Computer and information research scientist</h2>
<p>These high skilled professionals&nbsp;spend their work days inventing and designing new approaches to computing technology while also discovering innovative uses for technologies that already exist. Computer and information research scientists can work in business, science, medicine and other fields to study and solve complex problems, creating and improving computer software and hardware.</p>
<h2>14. Network architect</h2>
<p>Network Architect use their backgrounds in networking technology to assess business and application requirements for phone, data and internet systems for an organization. This includes planning, designing and upgrading network installation projects, troubleshooting network architecture, making recommendations for system enhancements and maintaining backup, version-control and defense systems. Network architects help business leaders make informed decisions on network investments that fit their short and long-term needs.</p>
