<h1>How to open and view a document in Microsoft Word</h1>
<p class="intro">Microsoft Word is one of the most popular word processing programs used by computer users. Word can open text&nbsp;(.txt) files, rich text format&nbsp;(.rtf) files, XML&nbsp;(.xml) files, web page&nbsp;(.htm or .html) files, and all Word (.doc, .docx, .docm, and more) files.</p>
<p>To open any of the above types of documents in Microsoft Word, you can use any of the options below.</p>
<h2>Double-click file</h2>
<p class="tab">In some cases, you can double click a file to open it in Microsoft Word. However, the file only opens in Microsoft Word if that file type&nbsp;is associated with Microsoft Word. Word documents, like .doc and .docx files, are associated with Microsoft Word by default. However, web page files, text, and rich text&nbsp;format files are often not associated with Word by default, so double-clicking on these files may open in another program.</p>
<h2>Right-click file and select program</h2>
<p class="tab">For any file, you can choose the program to open a file with, including Microsoft Word.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right Click the file you want to open.</li>
<li>In the pop-up menu, select the&nbsp;<strong>Open with</strong>&nbsp;option.</li>
<li>If available, choose the Microsoft Word program option in the Open with menu. If Microsoft Word is not listed, select the&nbsp;<strong>Choose other app</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Choose default program</strong>&nbsp;option, depending on the version of Windows on your computer.</li>
