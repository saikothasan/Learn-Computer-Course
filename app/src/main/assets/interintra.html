<h1>Internet</h1>
<p>This worldwide system of computer networks. This allows the access and exchange of other computers&rsquo; information, enabling an array of services that cover communication, entertainment, and news. Information&nbsp;from July 2019 saw that 56% of the world&rsquo;s population &ndash; nearly five billion people &ndash; were active internet users. From entertainment to finance, to learning and innovating, the internet underpins every area of our lives. With the Internet of Things, the applications are endless (and in some cases, risible). You can heat your home, power a driverless car, even help you eliminate noisy slurps while eating ramen &ndash; all with the help of a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h1>Intranet</h1>
<p>An intranet, on the other hand, has a reduced set of functions which are primarily aligned with helping employees within a business. While similar to the internet in that it is a computer network that shares information &ndash; an intranet operates strictly within a closed network. This is beneficial for organizations who want to submit and exchange company information privately.</p>
<h2>Working of the Internet</h2>
<p>The Internet is a network created by the interconnection of a large number of computer networks which is not owned by an entity. There is no central administration to the internet, any person in the world can join it. This entire network of networks works through following some standards and rules (i.e., protocols).</p>
<p>TCP/IP protocol is the main impelling agent for the internet used by the connected networks along with the other protocols like HTTP, FTP and SMTP. There are several other protocols and application which we have been using since the evolution of the internet such as Telnet, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), Internet Relay Chat, Gopher, Usenet News, WWW(World Wide Web).</p>
<h2>Working of an Intranet</h2>
<p>However, an intranet is a private computer network but it uses internet protocols, network connectivity and possibly the public telecommunication system to access and share the organization&rsquo;s information and operations securely with its staff.</p>
<p>It utilizes the same client-server model running on the TCP/IP protocol suite, similar to the internet. Information within an organization can be retrieved through browsers which do not depend on the platform. It could also work without installing special softwares on the client machines.\</p>
<h2>Key Differences Between Internet and Intranet</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Internet provides unlimited information which can be viewed by everyone whereas, in Intranet, data circulates within the organization.</li>
<li>The Internet provides access to everyone. As against, intranet permits authenticate users only to access it.</li>
<li>An intranet is a private network that belongs to a firm or an institution. On the contrary, the Internet is not owned by any single or multiple organization.</li>
<li>The Internet is available to all while, Intranet is restricted.</li>
<li>An intranet is safer as compared to the Internet.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Similarities Between Internet and Intranet</h2>
<ol>
<li>Both Internet and Intranet can be accessed using a browser.</li>
<li>They use Internet Protocols for transferring data.</li>
<li>Both of them are used to share information with the users over the network.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hence, we conclude that both the Internet and Intranet have some similar aspects and dissimilarities as well. The Internet is a collection of various LAN, MAN, and WAN whereas, Intranet mostly is a LAN, MAN or WAN. Furthermore, an intranet is safer as compared to the Internet since the user login keeps updating at regular intervals and it confines to an organization.</p>
